\lettrine[lines=3]{T}\ \textsc{he Delphic oracle advises}, "know
thyself." This injunction takes on special urgency in the Modern period.
Several notable figures, including Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz,
construe self-reflection as central to all knowledge, including
knowledge of the natural world. Hume then levies a variety of criticisms
against the epistemological and metaphysical presuppositions of these
views, and Kant attempts to reconcile much of Hume's critique with a
non-skeptical position regarding our knowledge of nature. Though this
dialectic is no doubt familiar, Kant's evolving views with respect to it
bear closer scrutiny.

Kant, of course, is famous for proclaiming a "Copernican revolution"
according to which "we can cognize of things a priori only what we
ourselves have put into them" (Bxviii). Emphasizing the centrality of
the cognizing subject, Kant claims that "the standing and lasting I (of
pure apperception) constitutes the correlate of all of our
representations" (A123; see also B138) such that

> we ourselves bring into the appearances that order and regularity
> in them that we call nature, and moreover we would not be able to find
> it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not originally put it
> there. (A125; see also B165)

\noindent Critical reflection on the "I" of apperception thus yields
knowledge of the most general laws of nature, where "\[t\]he synthetic
unity of consciousness is...an objective condition of all cognition"
(B138) and

> all appearances of nature, as far as their combination is concerned,
> stand under the categories, on which nature (considered merely as
> nature in general) depends, as the original ground of its necessary
> lawfulness (as *natura formaliter spectata*). (B165)

Kant's startling emphasis on the role of the subject in the constitution
of the laws of nature, and thus in the constitution of scientific
knowledge of nature, is relatively well-known. But agreement that the
subject plays such a role in organizing nature does not tell us how or why
it plays this role. In particular, it is not clear why Kant would think
that *self-consciousness*, as modeled by his theory of pure
apperception, would be central to an account of how knowledge of nature
is possible. 

In what follows, I explicate one way in which pure apperception plays a
crucial role for Kant in explaining the possibility of a science of
nature. I argue that Kant must appeal to pure apperception as the only
possible source of the content of the categorical concept `<substance>`,
in so far as this concept is understood to have anything more than
purely logical or grammatical significance. Kant of course distinguishes
between the logical/grammatical notion of a concept's always taking the
subject place in a categorical judgment, from the "schematized" or
temporal conception of a substance as a permanent being. However,
between these two notions lies the conception of a substance purely as a
metaphysical subject, as that in which a property (an "accident")
inheres. This notion is necessary for Kant to carry out his account of
the possibility of a science of nature, but it cannot be analytically
derived from the purely logical conception of a subject. I argue that
pure apperception is the only possible source for such a representation.[^69]

In section one, I clarify this intermediary sense of a substance
understood purely as the subject of inherent properties. I also indicate
its role in Kant's conception of a science of nature. Section two
briefly discusses why Kant cannot appeal to the content of intuition in
order to resolve the question of the source of the content of the
concept, before turning to pure apperception. I then provide a positive
account of the nature of apperception and its role in provisioning the
content of our concept `<substance>`, after which I discuss a variety of
objections that arise concerning the way in which the interpretation
integrates with other aspects of Kant's mature critical theory of
cognition. I thus argue that, despite important differences, Kant's
strategy is one whose outline is broadly similar to that pursued by
(among others) Descartes, Leibniz, and the pre-critical Kant, according
to which the 'I' is the original basis for all scientific knowledge of
nature.

# The Problem of the Subject #

We can better understand Kant's position on self-knowledge and its
significance for knowledge of nature by situating it with respect to a
problem I call "the problem of the subject." The problem stems from
holding both that our senses are our primary access to reality and that
the senses provide no access to the ultimate subjects of
properties.[^65] Instead, the senses present only properties. This
problem seems to have been widely recognized.[^175133] For example, in
the General Scholium to the *Principia* Issac Newton writes,

[^175133]: See also [@locke1970, 546 (EHU IV.iii.14)]; [@boyle1991-ch1,
    13]; [@kant1992a, 385 (ID 2:393)]; [@herz1771, 123]. 

> we certainly do not know what is the substance of any thing. We see
> only the shapes and colors of bodies, we hear only their sounds, we
> touch only their external surfaces, we smell only their odors, and we
> taste their flavors. But there is no direct sense and there are no
> indirect reflected actions by which we know innermost substances
> [@newton2004, 91]

\noindent For Newton, neither the senses nor reflection on the material
provided by the senses leads to knowledge concerning the metaphysical
subject of presented sensory qualities. This raises the question as to
how, if the senses provide no access to the metaphysical subjects of
properties, we can think about, much less have knowledge concerning,
such subjects, including ourselves.

The problem of the subject thus is the problem that arises because the
senses do not give access to the metaphysical subjects of the manifest
qualities we perceive in the world around us. Let me briefly expand on
what I mean by "metaphysical subject" and "access" before going on to
look at the issue as it is addressed by Kant.

The basic notion of a metaphysical subject is a substance, understood as
that in which properties inhere. Substances thus *substand*, and they
also *subsist*, or exist independently of other things. Because of these
two features, substances are loci of explanation. Non-substantial
beings, such as properties or events, might stand in as loci of
explanation in limited cases. For example, one might say of a fight that
it is vicious, or of a rainbow that it is beautiful. Similarly, one
might hope of justice that it is blind. But the fight and the rainbow
are adjectival on the beings which constitute them (respectively, the
fighters and the raindrops), while talk of the blindness of justice, if
we are to avoid reifying the property, is purely metaphorical. Hence,
substance plays its explanatory role because the inherence relation that
a property has to the substance which has it is a dependence relation
that the substance does not stand in to anything else.[^70]

<!-- TODO: Fix the above discussion! -->

Proper or scientific knowledge of nature requires, in the broadly
Aristotelian tradition within which Kant is enmeshed, knowledge of why
things are the way that they are.[^1] Because properties depend
asymmetrically on the substances that have them, the study of substance
is what is supposed to tell us why some property or pattern of
properties may be instantiated. Hence, the object of proper scientific
study is substance. Such knowledge, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries was typically regarded as a priori, not (or not just) because
(as in our contemporary usage of "a priori") it is supposedly knowable
independently of experience, but rather because experience can at best
provide knowledge of what is the case. For example, experience
only tells one that some determinate quality is instantiated. It cannot
tell one *why* that is the case.[^2] 

Leibniz provides one well-known account of the apriori source of our
concept of a substance.[^71] Leibniz argues that it is via introspection or
"reflection" that one first grasps the concept of a substance in virtue
of reflecting on one's self as a substance with causal powers. Leibniz
develops this view in his reply to Locke's objections concerning innate
ideas, arguing that reflection is a form of non-sensory awareness of our
mind and its states. Commenting on Locke's theory concerning the origin
of all of our ideas in his *New Essays on Human Understanding*, Leibniz
says:

> Perhaps our able author will not entirely disagree with my opinion.
> For...he admits...that the ideas which do not originate in sensation
> come from reflection. Now, reflection is nothing other than attention
> to what is within us, and the senses do not give us what we already
> bring with us. Given this, can anyone deny that there is a great deal
> innate in our mind, since we are innate to ourselves, so to speak, and
> since we have within ourselves being, unity, substance, duration,
> change, action, perception, pleasure, and a thousand other objects of
> our intellectual ideas? And since these objects are immediate and
> always present to our understanding (though they may not always be
> perceived consciously on account of our distractions and our needs),
> why should it be surprising that we say that these ideas, and
> everything that depends upon them, are innate in us? [@leibniz1996,
> 294]

\noindent Since reflection is simply "attention to what is within us",
all relevant ideas (concepts) of a substantial subject are gained by
reflection on ourselves. We might not always attend to the fact that we
are simple, active, (etc.) substances, but this fact is available to us
on reflection. In the *Monadology* Leibniz further emphasizes this
position, arguing that

> it is the knowledge of necessary and eternal truths which
> distinguishes us from simple animals and gives us reason and the
> sciences, lifting us to the knowledge of ourselves and of God...it is
> thus, as we think of ourselves, that we think of being, of substance,
> of the simple and the compound, of the immaterial, and of God himself,
> conceiving of that which is limited in us as being without limits in
> him. These reflective acts provide us with the principal objects of
> our reasonings \[@leibniz1969b, 645-6; §§29-30\].

\noindent In these passages I take Leibniz to make two claims.
First, the scientific knowledge that we have of nature depends on, and
is posterior to, our epistemic grasp of ourselves. Second, the priority
of self-knowledge in our understanding of nature comes from the role the
self plays as a *source* of the content of our ideas (or concepts).

In arguing that the self is a privileged source of representational
content, Leibniz endorses what I call the "Difference Thesis" regarding
introspection.[^13] Introspection provides a relation to ourselves as
subjects that is epistemically distinctive from our relation to any
other part of nature. The privileged and peculiar epistemic access we
have to ourselves, coupled with claims concerning what the self
is---viz. a simple unitary substance---thus provides a basis for
resolving the problem of the subject. It is this access that we each
have to ourselves that is thus the basis of our knowledge of anything
external to us as a substantial thing. Rejecting the Difference Thesis
would, according to these thinkers, thus be tantamount to rejecting the
possibility of knowledge of nature *tout court*.

Kant explicitly indicates his endorsement of such a position in a 1769
note on Baumgarten's *Metaphysica*.[^9]

<!-- TODO: connect the discussin of something = x to Kant's notion of a -->
<!-- transcedental object (Tobias's suggestion) -->

> by means of our senses only the relations of things can be
> revealed, and we can represent the absolute or the subject only from
> our selves. The idea of substance actually comes from the
> *repraesentatione sui ipsius*, insofar as we represent that something
> is separate from us, and predicates cannot be thought without a
> subject and without an ultimate subject; the constant predicates
> together are then called the subject. (R3921, 17:346; see also
> R5290,18:144; R5297, 18:146; R4493, 17:571-2; AC 25:14)
    
\noindent Here Kant argues that the senses present only (in the outer
case) determinate instances of determinables such as extension,
solidity, rest, and motion. The senses by themselves do not present us
with a subject of such qualities. The only presentation of such a
subject comes in the intuition of the self---the "idea of substance
actually comes from the *repraesentatione sui ipsius*." We then move to
a thought of external substances by treating the "constant predicates
together" as a stand-in for the metaphysical subject.

Kant continues to endorse the idea that the self is the source of our
conception of a substantial thing well into the 1770's. In the quote
that forms the epigraph to the present paper, Kant writes that an object
may be represented only "according to its relations", i.e., only
according to the qualities, and relations between those qualities, that
are presented in sense experience. However, in contrast to his position
concerning external objects, Kant claims that we possess special access
to a self whose qualities are not presented in this manner.[^11] The
self is thus the "original of all objects" in the sense that, as Allison
Laywine puts it, "we somehow transfer our representations of the one
true subject and apply it derivatively or by analogy to our thought of
anything else."[^12] For the pre-critical Kant, introspection
provides a form of non-sensory intuitive acquaintance with the self as a
metaphysical subject, and it is via this acquaintance that we can then
form by analogy the representations of objects (construed as
metaphysical subjects of properties) distinct from us.

Hence, despite Kant's somewhat radical departure from German rationalism
in 1769, with the recognition of two distinct stems of cognition---viz.
sensibility and intellect, Kant nevertheless continues to pursue a
strategy for resolving the problem of the subject that is deeply
sympathetic to the rationalist tradition. By means of the Difference
Thesis Kant, like Leibniz, argues for the legitimacy of central
metaphysical concepts including, but not limited to, the concept of a
metaphysical subject or substance. 

<!-- TODO: Explain more clearly the sense in which the self is the -->

<!-- is innate? That it is a priori?  -->

Hume famously challenges the Difference Thesis, and with it the priority
and source claims. He undermines the priority claim by arguing against
the source claim. There is no substantial self that is disclosed
by virtue of any possible act of introspection. Hence there is no
way in which self-knowledge has any peculiar epistemic priority to
knowledge of the rest of nature. 

> Philosophers begin to be reconcil'd to the principle, that we have no

> qualities. This must pave the way for a like principle with regard to
> the mind, that we have no notion of it, distinct from the particular
> perceptions. [@hume1888, 635]

\noindent Our concept of a self, just like our concept of any other
member of the natural world, is ultimately of nothing more than a bundle
of perceived properties. Anything else is just an invented fiction.

Similarly, for the critical Kant, there is no deep psychological or
epistemological sense in which intuition of one's states differs from
intuition of the states of other objects. We see this by considering
that, for Kant, "a manifold’s combination (*Verbindung*) as such can
never come to us through the senses" (B129). Predication is a form of
combination. It's categorial counterpart is *inherence*. The senses
cannot present anything as predicated of anything, and correspondingly,
of any quality as inhering in anything.[^48]

Kant also makes various statements concerning the fact that there is no
intuition of the self as object. For example, 

> Inner sense, by means of which the mind intuits itself, or its inner
> state, gives, to be sure, no intuition of the soul itself, as object
> [*Object*]. (A22/B37)

> The consciousness of ourself in accordance with the determinations of
> our state in internal perception is merely empirical, forever
> variable; it can give no standing or abiding self in this stream of
> inner appearances [*es kann kein stehendes oder bleibendes Selbst in
> diesem Flusse innrer Erscheinungen geben*], and is customarily called
> **inner sense** or **empirical apperception**. (A107)

\noindent Passages like these have led various interpreters to the
conclusion that Kant, much like Hume, endorses an "elusiveness thesis"
regarding the appearance (or, more accurately, lack thereof) of the self
in inner sense. I take Kant's endorsement of the elusiveness of the
subject in sensory introspection to be required by his view concerning
the nature of the structure or content of intuition. Intuition cannot
provision a cognitive subject with representations whose content
involves predication or the presentation of one thing's inhering in
something else. There is nothing special, in this regard, concerning
inner sense. As we saw above, the point about predication and inherence
being absent in intuition is a wholly general claim, and holds of outer
sense just as of inner. In general, as I argued above, intuition does
not say anything "of" anything. It simply presents, and Kant takes
sensory intuition to present qualities or states, not subjects thereof.[^72]

Thus, in contrast to Kant's views in the 1770's, where he explicitly
contrasts the nature of what is given in introspection vs extrospection,
the critical Kant rejects the Difference Thesis, at least with regard to
what is available *in intuition*.[^27] There is no intuition of the self
as subject that provides the basis for our awareness of other substances
distinct from ourselves. Empirical introspection and extrospection are
psychologically and epistemically on par.[^16]

# Apperception, Self-Ascription, & Knowledge of Nature #

As we've seen, at least by the publication of the first *Critique* Kant
no longer unqualifiedly endorses the Difference Thesis. He now denies
that we can have anything like a privileged *intuition* of the self, and
so no longer thinks that we obtain a representation of a substantial
being by virtue of an intuition of the self.

However, the centrality of the transcendental unity of apperception,
especially in the B-Deduction, indicates that there is *some* sense to
be made of the centrality of self-knowledge to resolving the problem of
the subject. Certainly Kant is clear that the way in which the subject
is represented in pure apperception, involves its existence, but not its
(e.g.) simplicity or incorporeality. Moreover, the awareness of oneself
as subject is purely intellectual. For example, he says,

> this representation [viz. the "I think"] is an act [*Actus*] of
> spontaneity, i.e., it cannot be regarded as belonging to sensibility.
> (B-Deduction §16, B132)

> In the transcendental synthesis of the manifold of representations in
> general, on the contrary, hence in the synthetic original unity of
> apperception, I am conscious of myself not as I appear to myself, nor
> as I am in myself, but only that I am. This representation is a
> thinking, not an intuiting. (B-Deduction §25, B157)

> The consciousness of myself in the representation I is no intuition at
> all, but a merely intellectual representation of the self-activity of
> a thinking subject. (Refutation of Idealism, B278)

> if I have called the proposition "I think" an empirical proposition, I
> would not say by this that the I in this proposition is an empirical
> representation; for it is rather purely intellectual, because it
> belongs to thinking in general. (Refutation of Mendelssohn's proof of
> the persistence of the soul, B423)

\noindent Kant's position in these passages is that sensory
introspection provides only an awareness of states of thinking, feeling,
sensation, etc. It provides no awareness of a subject of such states. In
contrast, the awareness of one's self as *subject*, as an existing being
in which mental states inhere, is not sensory at all, but is itself an
act of thought---viz. apperception.[^63] It is here, in pure
apperception, that the critical Kant reaches for the source of our
representation of a substance. Kant says that "in the synthetic original
unity of apperception, I am conscious...that I am" (B157). If, as Kant
says, I am conscious in apperception of my own existence, then I am
conscious of myself as the subject of the thought "I exist". In being
conscious of myself as the subject of the thought "I exist" I am
conscious of that thought as possessed by and thus dependent upon
myself. Moreover, if what I have argued so far in this paper is correct,
there would seem to be no other form of representation (i.e.
intellectually, or in inner or outer sense) in which such a relation
between subject and property or state could be presented. Apperception,
as the vehicle through which a subject becomes aware of their mental
states as states of a particular subject---viz. oneself---is thus also
the only possible means by which a cognizer could grasp this relation of
dependence (as opposed to the merely grammatical relation between
subject and predicate) between a metaphysical subject and a
property.[^44]

<!-- TODO: Discuss difference between "I think" and "I am" -->
<!-- TODO: Kant says that the 'I think' is empirical (B428) -- why? -->

---
## Positive Proposal
---

My suggestion then is that the subject remains a cognitive model for the
conception of a substance as an underlying subject of properties even in
the Deduction, as well as in the critical period more generally. Since
Kant no longer thinks we have any legitimate epistemic access to such a
subject, in either extro or introspection, the only source left which
could present such a relation is the "mineness" of thought itself. In
having a first-person thought, one must be able to self-ascribe that
thought, and so must be able to grasp the fact that the thought belongs
to or depends on the subject having it.[^39] Given that we in fact do
plausibly represent properties as inhering in subjects (whether
ourselves or external objects), each of us must in fact have actualized
this capacity for self-ascription in introspection in our history as thinkers.

---
## Evidence for proposal
---

We can appreciate Kant's emphasis on apperceptive self-ascription by
noting four things. First, the emphasis Kant places, in §15 of the
B-Deduction, on the awareness of the act of synthesis, and not merely
the products of such synthesis (B130; see also A108).[^40] It is in the
having of a first-person thought that one is in a position to explicitly
acknowledge oneself as a subject in the just the relevant sense---viz.
as a subject of properties. This is something that one is not, and never
could be, in a position to do (or so I have argued that Kant believed)
merely by entertaining sensible representations. Kant's claim concerning
the need for awareness of synthesis is not a claim that the cognizing
subject must *intuit* themself as possessing some mental state, or as
engaged in some mental act. If it were then the very same objection
concerning the absence of combination in sense would arise as Kant
initially raises in §15 of the Deduction. So instead, Kant must be
conceiving of such self-awareness as a kind of reflexive and
non-empirical awareness of one's activity *as one's own* and thus as
dependent upon one's self.

Second, immediately after introducing the need for an awareness of the
act of synthesis as the ultimate condition of the unity of
representation, Kant goes on to argue, in §16, that the source of this
is in the "I think" (B131-2). It is precisely the potentially explicit
awareness of ownership inherent in the act of self-ascribing a thought
that allows one to move from the mere having of a sensory consciousness
awareness of (what are in fact) one's states to being aware of oneself
as being in some state or other, and thus as the subject of those states.

> The thought that these representations given in intuition all together
> belong to me means, accordingly, the same as that I unite them in a
> self-consciousness, or at least can unite them therein, and although
> it is itself not yet the consciousness of the synthesis of the
> representations, it still presupposes the possibility of the latter,
> i.e., only because I can comprehend their manifold in a consciousness
> do I call them all together my representations; for otherwise I would
> have as multicolored, diverse a self as I have representations of
> which I am conscious. (B134)

\noindent Kant need not be construed here as arguing that we grasp the
underlying metaphysical identity of the subject in the having of
I-thoughts. He thus need not be read as conflating the metaphysical
issue of what it is that constitutes the connection between distinct
properties or representations in a single subject with the
epistemological question of their (self-)ascription.[^41] Instead, Kant
argues here that we are only in a position to even be able to think
about the metaphysical question of the connection between properties or
representations and the subject which has them because we already grasp
one such instance of such a connection in the having of an 'I-thought'.

Third, and relatedly, Kant emphasizes that pure apperception is
"original" because "it is that self-consciousness which, because it
produces the representation I think...cannot be accompanied by any
further representation" (B132). This "intellectual consciousness" (Bxl)
of oneself as the subject and owner of one's mental states cannot itself
be derived from any other kind of representation. Kant goes so far to
say that the principles of "the objective determination of all
representations, insofar as cognition can come from them....are all
derived from the principle of the transcendental unity of apperception"
(B142). Thus, Kant is not trying to give an account or theory of how we
can answer the epistemic question of the basis of the "mineness" of a
thought. Instead, he is using the fact that thinking presupposes the
grasp (or capacity thereto) of one's thoughts as one's own as a way of
supplying a potential answer to the question of how we can think of a
metaphysical subject that is the unity of any given set of appearances
at all.[^62]

Fourth, Kant's entire strategy in the critical period involves
elucidating the cognitive powers of the *cognizing subject*. Kant
repeatedly, and throughout his career, characterizes a power as a
relation of a substance to its accidents and explicitly denies that the
soul, as cognizing subject, could itself be regarded as a power, as
e.g., Wolff did (ML~1~, 28:261; see also MH, 28:25, 145; R 4762, 17:720
[1775–78]<!-- TODO: need more citations -->).[^60] Moreover, accidents,
as Kant clearly states in the first *Critique*, are "determinations of a
substance that are nothing other than particular ways for it to exist"
(A186/B229), the existence of which is called "inherence, in contrast to
the existence of the substance, which is called 'subsistence'"
(A187-7/B230).[^61] While Kant's conception of the cognizing subject as
a subject whose powers explain the existence of its accidents (as mental
states), doesn't entail anything in particular about his view concerning
pure apperception, his theory of cognition does require some explanation
of the source of the representation of such a metaphysical subject, and
pure apperception seems to be the best (and in fact only remaining)
explanation.

## Objections ##

Nevertheless, there are several important objections to this account
that deserve discussion. In brief, we need to consider whether this
position is consistent with Kant's argument in the first Paralogism,
whether it is consistent with his strategy in the Metaphysical
Deduction, and whether it ultimately can make sense even as a qualified
solution to the problem of the subject. I take these in turn.

### The First Paralogism ###

First, one might object that the position I attribute to Kant violates
his commitment to epistemic humility, particularly concerning the
nature of the subject as a substance. Essentially, one worries that I
attribute to Kant a position similar or identical to the position in
rational psychology against which he argues in the first Paralogism.

In the A-edition, Kant agrees that "in all our thinking the **I** is
subject" but asks what sort of use we are to make of knowledge (A349). Here
he is primarily concerned with the issue of the supposed *permanence* of
the soul, 

> That I, as a thinking being, **endure** for myself, that naturally I
> **neither arise** nor **perish** - this I can by no means infer, and
> yet it is for that alone that the concept of the substantiality of my
> thinking subject can be useful to me; without that I could very well
> dispense with it altogether. (A349)

\noindent Kant's primary aim here is not to argue against the
position that the soul is substance, but rather to argue against the
epistemic fecundity of an argument from the first-person concept to a
conclusion about permanence.[^50] 

Looking at the B-edition, one might reply that this defense is not
cogent, for Kant appears to explicitly deny that pure apperception
reveals anything about the subject.

> Thinking, taken in itself [*für sich*], is merely the logical function
> and hence the sheer spontaneity of combining the manifold of a merely
> possible intuition; and in no way does it present the subject of
> consciousness as appearance...In this way I represent myself to myself
> neither as I am nor as I appear to myself, but rather I think myself
> only as I do every object in general from whose kind of intuition I
> abstract. If here I represent myself as **subject** of a thought or
> even as **ground** of thinking, then these ways of representing do not
> signify the categories of substance or cause, for these categories are
> those functions of thinking (of judging) applied to our sensible
> intuition, which would obviously be demanded if I wanted to
> **cognize** myself. (B428-9)

\noindent Kant here denies that pure apperception ("I think") presents
any sort of sensory or intellectual appearance, but he also might seem
to deny that pure apperception presents anything as subject or ground,
in the metaphysical sense with which the categories are concerned.
However, there are three points that mitigate these concerns.

First, Kant is focussed on the issue of cognition, as the last clause of
the passage indicates, so his rhetoric is directed at the position that
we have cognition of the subject as permanent (using the category of
substance) or as the causal basis (as ground) of thought. That is,
Kant's position is exactly the same as was stated in the A-edition of
the first Paralogism. 

Second, and reinforcing the concern with cognition, Kant goes on to say
that "in the consciousness of myself in mere thinking I am the **being
itself**" (B429), which indicates that though I have no cognition of
myself (that would require intuition, of which there are none in pure
apperception), I nevertheless am conscious of myself as the subject of
my thoughts.[^52] 

Finally, the fact that, in pure apperception, I am aware of my thoughts
as *mine*, goes beyond any merely logical or grammatical claim, as might
be granted merely to the form of categorical judgment or the
unschematized category of substance. The awareness of a thought as mine
is not simply the awareness of a grammatical subject of predication. It
is an awareness of *me*, and specifically, of myself as think*er*.[^51]
Kant allows that we have such awareness of ourselves as thinkers (indeed
he argues for this) in the B-Deduction. He does not renounce this
position in the first Paralogism (or in the Paralogisms more generally),
and nothing he argues there goes against it. If this is correct, it does
mean that Kant's argument in the Paralogisms is perhaps more limited
than some have taken it to be. But it doesn't mean ascribing to him either the
kind of position in rational psychology that he criticizes or in
limiting him to a wholly austere position regarding the self as subject. 

A further objection, raised by Karl Ameriks, is that the admission that
the 'I' is "absolute" in the metaphysical sense here at issue does not
actually prove what is needed.  

> The representation 'I' is absolute here in that there is no proper way
> of representing these thoughts which leaves no room for the phrase 'I
> think'. Yet this does not mean that I am truly the absolute subject of
> my thoughts as a substantial mental being...as long as it is
> metaphysically possible...that what I take to be a substantial soul is

> be an accident or resultant of those beings, and so but a prima-facie
> or relative and not absolute subject, and yet the representation 'I'
> would retain its ultimacy [in the sense at issue].[^54]

\noindent Ameriks takes this possibility to be simply ignored in the
A-edition Paralogisms, but then taken up in the B-edition, where Kant
provides an argument against the "mere assertion" of the substantiality
of the soul at B410-12 [-@ameriks2000a, 70]. Ameriks puts his challenge
in terms of realization by multiple substances, but the issue could just
as well be pressed by appeal to a single substance (such as God) of
which we are all accidents. This is also suggested by the fact that Kant
goes on to claim that "it is not determined whether I could exist and be
thought of only as subject and not as predicate of another thing"
(B419).[^56]

However, all that these passages show is that Kant denies that we can
cognize or otherwise come to *know* ourselves as ultimate subjects.
Kant's arguments do not show that it is unwarranted to *believe* that
the self is substantial.[^58]<!-- TODO: Is this right? Say more about
belief --> The arguments are also perfectly compatible with the central
interpretive claim that I advance---viz. that it is in pure
apperception, and nowhere else, that we come to be able to represent a
metaphysical subject. Perhaps pure apperception is provisioning us with
a misrepresentation. Sufficient theoretical grounds could never be given
to demonstrate the truth of it or its opposite.[^55]

### The Metaphysical Deduction ###

The second objection to my proposed interpretation is that in
maintaining that the 'I' remains the original of all objects by
providing us with a model of a metaphysical subject, the interpretation
goes against Kant's strategy in the so-called "Metaphysical Deduction" (MD)
to derive the categories from the structure of judgment. Why would Kant
need to appeal to self-knowledge in the provisioning of the concept of a
substance if he took his argument in the MD, an argument that appears
*before* the discussion of apperception, as broadly cogent?

In reply, it is important to note that the MD provides only a "clue" to
the categories. Moreover, these unschematized categories are themselves
merely logical in nature. For example, the form of judgment from which
Kant derives the category of substance is the categorical judgment --
i.e. judgment with subject-predicate structure. As far as logic is
concerned any concept may be used either as subject or as predicate. The
category of substance is used to specify that which "in experience must
always be considered as subject, never as mere predicate" (B129). It is
interesting that Kant continues to speak here of substance in
logico-grammatical terms. When he then discusses the "schematized"
version of the category of substance he says that it "is the persistence
of the real in time" (A144/B183). But what falls between these two
conceptions of substance is precisely that which Kant requires in
resolving the problem of the subject---viz. a metaphysical subject of
accidents or properties broadly construed---and is available neither
from any experience of phenomenal substance as the permanent (which
presupposes this conception) nor from the merely logico-grammatical
conception of a subject of predicates. So, whence comes the conception
of this metaphysical subject?[^68] If my discussion above is correct, it
comes from the only source it *could* come from---viz. the subject's
grasp of itself and its states as its own.[^53]

At best, however, this just shows that Kant *needs* to appeal to
apperception to fill a gap in his view concerning the sources of
representational content and the content of our a priori concepts. It
doesn't tell us that he was aware of such a gap, or that he intended to
appeal to apperception to fill it. The existence of the Metaphysical
Deduction might then be seen as evidence against both of these latter
points. Connected to this, we can also articulate an additional concern
that, if I am correct, Kant's reliance on apperception in the way I claim might
undermine his argumentative strategy for *all* the categories, insofar
as they are supposed to be derived or derivable from the forms of
judgment.[^175134] Does apperception therefore make the Metaphysical Deduction
otiose?

I want to make three points in response to such worries. First, as I
have already noted in introducing my positive proposal, Kant actually
says in the B-Deduction that the principles of “the objective
determination of all representations, insofar as cognition can come from
them...are all derived from the principle of the transcendental unity of
apperception” (B142). Moreover, the structure of his argument in the
B-Deduction also strongly suggests, and possibly even requires,
construing the categories as depending on apperception. For example,
Kant is clear in §15 that all unity of concepts, including the
categories, depends on a unity "someplace higher" (B131). Given the
content of §16, this is clearly apperception that Kant has in mind. 

Second, it is not at all clear that *all* of the categories might be
derivable (much less derived) from apperception.[^175135] For example, perhaps
only the categories of relation are so connected to apperception that
they gain at least part of their content from it.[^175136]

Finally, even if the categories all owe at least some of their structure
or content to apperception, this does not render otiose the strategy
Kant pursues in the argument of the Metaphysical Deduction, for there
Kant is primarily concerned to provide some unitary and a priori basis
for determining exactly which of our concepts are cognitively
fundamental and a priori. 

> Transcendental philosophy has the advantage but also the obligation to
> seek its concepts in accordance with a principle, since they spring
> pure and unmixed from the understanding, as absolute unity, and must
> therefore be connected among themselves in accordance with a concept
> or idea. Such a connection, however, provides a rule by means of which
> the place of each pure concept of the understanding and the
> completeness of all of them together can be determined *a priori*, which
> would otherwise depend upon whim or chance. (A67/B92)

\noindent This then is the central role for the argument of the
Metaphysical Deduction, in providing a principled and a priori basis for
*exhaustively* determining which are the fundamental concepts. Kant
wants an argument which,

> has not arisen rhapsodically from a haphazard search for pure
> concepts, of the completeness of which one could never be certain,
> since one would only infer it through induction, without reflecting
> that in this way one would never see why just these and not other
> concepts should inhabit the pure understanding. (A81/B106-7)

\noindent Hence, even if I am right concerning the connection between
apperception and the content of the concept `<substance>`, and it is
true that there is a similar connection for all the other categories,
there would still remain, for Kant, a need for a derivation like the
kind he sketches in the Metaphysical Deduction. 

<!-- TODO: Why can't we get the requisite content by *analogy* to the
grammatical notion? -->

### Indeterminacy ###

One further objection concerns the status of such indeterminate
"consciousness" of oneself as subject. As I've argued above, this
consciousness is not something that is or could ever rise to the level
of cognition or knowledge. How then could a mental state that counts as
neither cognition nor knowledge provide anything of sufficiently
determinate content that it could resolve the problem of the subject I've outlined
here? Even worse, if the consciousness of the 'I' as subject is bereft
of all qualities, as it must be if the apperception is "pure" in the
sense with which Kant is concerned, how is it that one is aware of any
feature of the self at all?

In reply to the first point, all that is being claimed concerning Kant's
argument in the first *Critique* is that consciousness of the self in
pure apperception remains the sole basis for the possession of
representational states presenting a metaphysical subject. This is
compatible with that representation being had in a context where
cognition or knowledge is nevertheless impossible. Concerning the second
point, as Kant says, "I am the being itself" that is thinking, but
whatever I am aware of with respect to myself beyond this fact in any
act of thought (or any self-ascription of a mental state more broadly),
that awareness is dependent (or "determined") by some empirical
intuition. This means that one is not aware of any feature of the
*noumenal* self other than that the appearance of such and such ways
(e.g. as upset, hungry, believing that it will rain, etc.) of existing.
With respect to how one appears to oneself, it is via an empirical grasp
of some quality in introspection (via inner sense---e.g. pain) and then
the self-ascription of that quality to oneself via the intellectual act
of pure apperception---e.g. that *I* am in pain---which apprehends only
the "mineness" of whatever was given in inner sense.

# Conclusion #

We have seen that Kant must provide an account of how we come to have
the representation of a subject of accidents or properties broadly
construed---viz. a substance. While the Kant of the 1770s attempts to
provide a broadly Leibnizian account, according to which we have special
intuitive access to the self as a substantial subject, this route is no
longer an option in the critical period. We thus see that the mature
critical Kant confronts the problem of explaining our representation of
substance in its most acute form. Given Kant's prohibition in intuition
of the self, and his broader epistemic humility regarding the
possibility of cognition of any robust feature of the self (such as its
immortality or simplicity), he would seem to be entirely without the
cognitive resources necessary for explaining the experience and
knowledge that we seemingly do possess concerning a world of substantial
bodies in physical interaction, and the empirical subjects who cognize
them.

Kant's ingenious move is to argue that, even amongst such limited
resources as allowed by the epistemic humility characteristic of the
critical period, the 'I' still remains the original of all objects. It
does so in the sense that the act of self-ascription itself is
sufficient for grasping the dependence of the thought on its "owner",
and thus grasping the basic relationship between a subject and its
properties necessary for understanding anything as a substance, and thus
as the potential object of properly scientific knowledge. Such
self-ascription doesn't tell us anything about what the subject is.
Indeed, we cannot even know whether this representation accurately
describes the reality of our own existence as ultimate subjects. Thus
nothing about the position I've ascribed to Kant on this matter violates
his overarching epistemic humility. Further, while the
I-as-subject-model grasped in the act of having a first-person thought
is sufficient for satisfying a necessary condition of scientific
knowledge of objects, it may well be that there are other conditions
that are also necessary for properly scientific knowledge of some domain
to be had, and that these might differ with respect to the objects of
inner vs. outer sense.[^42]

A further attraction of this interpretation is that it clarifies at least
one line of response that Kant provides to Hume. Hume is notoriously
critical of the position that we have any knowledge of the nature of the
self (as a substance), or any knowledge derived from our knowledge of
the nature of the self (e.g. as being a *simple* substance).

> THERE are some philosophers, who imagine we are every moment
> intimately conscious of what we call our SELF; that we feel its
> existence and its continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond
> the evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect identity and
> simplicity. ... Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary
> to that very experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any
> idea of *self*, after the manner it is here explain'd. For from what
> impression cou'd this idea be deriv'd ? [@hume1888, THN I.iv.6, p. 251]

Hume's argument seems particularly cutting to anyone who accepts, as
Kant does, that sense provides no original subject, and that there are
no innate ideas to which one could appeal in order to remedy this fact.
However, Kant is able to agree with much of Hume's critique while
nevertheless avoiding the position at which Hume ultimately
arrives---viz. that the (non-fictitious) concept of the self, as well as
other 'external' objects, is nothing but that of a 'bundle' of
properties (representations).[^175137] According to Kant, there is a
source for the idea of a subject of properties that is inherent in the
structure of self-ascriptive thought, and which cannot be, as Hume
thinks, a 'fiction', since mere relations amongst the 'bundle' could
never explain the "mineness" of self-ascribed thought---of the thinker
as *subject*. There is no basis in association for making this so that
does not already presuppose what is meant to be explained.

This point may in fact explain Hume famous skeptical apostasy in the
Appendix to the *Treatise*.[^43] He says,

> having thus loosen'd all our particular perceptions, when I proceed to
> explain the principle of connexion, which binds them together, and
> makes us attribute to them a real simplicity and identity; I am

> [@hume1888, 635-6]

\noindent If I am right, Kant has the "hypothesis" which might effect
the desired reconciliation. On the position I take Kant to hold, we need
neither the sensory apprehension of some simple substance, nor the
sensory grasp of necessary connections in order to explain the grasp we
have of the self as subject. The act of self-ascription presents the
subject with the opportunity to reflect on its mental states as
belonging to it---whatever else "it" is---and thus present it with the
exemplar of a metaphysical subject. In this very limited sense then the
'I' remains the original of all objects.[^67]

[^2]: A priori knowability in this sense of knowledge of that in virtue
   of which something is the case, and not merely that it is the case,
   was widely held in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be the
   epistemic ideal towards which all doxastic states aim; see
   [@pasnau2014] for discussion. The influential *Port Royal Logic* of
   Arnauld and Nicole includes a definition of the apriori in terms of
   the "demonstration of effects by their causes"
   [@arnauld1683, 233; see also @adams1994, 109; @smit2009; @hogan2009, 53-4].
   Leibniz argued that there is “no true or existent fact, no true
   assertion, without there being a sufficient reason why it is thus and
   not otherwise” [-@leibniz1969b, 646 (§32)], and took the
   investigation of such grounds to be one of the central tasks of the
   intellect. Closer to Kant, Wolff provides a general definition of
   ground in terms of ‘that through which one can understand why
   something \[i.e. what is grounded\] is the case' [@wolff1751, §29].
   Kant's pre-critical conception of an antecedently determining ground
   seems to straightforwardly connect with these older notions. For
   discussion see [@longuenesse2001, 69-70; @hogan2009, 53].

[^7]: See [@pasnau2013a, 139] for expression of a similar view. The

    least some interpreters deny that Descartes is interested in arguing
    here for the intellectual grasp of an underlying subject of
    properties. See, e.g. [@williams1978, 220-1] and [@carriero2009,

[^10]: In his commentary on the *Dissertation*, Markus Herz also
    presents part of the problematic as concerning the fact that "Every
    part of our cognition is a judgment in which we attribute some
    determination to a thing as a predicate to a subject" [@herz1771,
    123] and that there is no obvious basis for determining what is to
    count as subject. He takes this to be a special epistemological
    challenge for our cognition of nature, with which Locke was
    concerned, and which Kant seeks to overcome.

[^11]: In a reflexion from the mid-1770's Kant says that "The I is the
    intuition of a substance" (R4493, 17:571 (1772-5)). In the
    *Metaphysics L~1~* lectures, from roughly the same period, Kant
    contrasts consciousness of external objects with consciousness of
    the self. One intuits oneself immediately, but the same is not true
    of external objects (28:224). The self (as intelligence) so intuited
    is substantial, simple, and immaterial (28:225-6). For discussion of
    the various texts in the *Duisburg Nachlaß* and Kant's endorsement
    of the rational psychology he would come to criticize see

[^14]: In the *Anthropology* Kant distinguishes between inner sense or
    "*sensus internus*" and interior sense or "*sensus interior*"
    (7:153). Kant argues that whereas inner sense is a faculty of
    empirical intuition, interior sense is a "receptivity of the subject
    to be determined by certain ideas for the preservation or rejection
    of the condition of these ideas". The salient difference here is
    that Kant does not take states of pleasure or pain to be
    *representational* in the way in which he takes intuitions to be
    (cf. CPJ 5:206). Pleasure and pain are rather conative states aiming
    at the prolongation or cessation of one's current state. However,
    this distinction aside, it does not seem that Kant would want to
    deny that pleasure and pain (or feeling \[*Gefühl*\] more generally)
    are temporally located, and thus elements of inner sense broadly
    construed. For related discussion see [@vogel1993, 879].


[^16]: Note that here and throughout, unless otherwise indicated, I am
    referring specifically to *intuition* and the intuitive awareness of
    what is presented in inner and outer sense. Such intuitions do not
    straightforwardly count as "perceptions" in Kant's sense, nor as
    "experiences". For discussion of these distinctions see
    [@mclear2014a, 770-2]. For further discussion of Kant's rejection of
    the Difference Thesis in the 1780's and thus the parity of inner and
    outer sense see [@mclear-manuscript-parity]. Below, I also discuss
    the fact that the critical Kant allows for non-empirical access of
    the subject in pure apperception.

[^17]: Kant makes similar claims in the *Prolegomena*. See 4:336-7. Kant
    does change his mind about the status of psychology as a science
    (4:295) after he writes the *Prolegomena*. At least by the time the
    *Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science* (1786), Kant
    explicitly rejects the idea that a doctrine of the soul could rise
    to "the rank of a science properly so-called" (MFNS 4:471) But this
    change of position needn't be understood as a repudiation of the
    parity of inner and outer sense with respect to the Difference
    Thesis.

[^18]: For discussion see [@caranti2007].

[^19]: Arthur Collins goes so far as to claim that "it is impossible to
    imagine what sensation could possibly be in the setting of inner
    sense" [@collins1999, 113; cf. @schmitz2015, 1045].

[^20]: In an annotation to the B-Preface Kant also says that it is the
    things outside of us "from which we after all get the whole matter
    for our cognitions, even for our inner sense" (Bxxxix, ann.); cf
    [@schmitz2015, 1045]. It is important to note, however, that Kant is
    here talking about material for *cognition* rather than
    representation simpliciter. More on this point below.

[^21]: See [@paton1936b, 389; but cf. -@paton1936a, 99-100];

[^22]: Because of his focus on the relation between inner sense and
    Kant's writings on idealism, Allison seems to make this slide. See
    [@allison2004, 294]. Allison also moves too quickly from claims
    concerning what is present in *experience*, construed as the outcome
    of conceptual synthesis, and what is strictly speaking present in
    *sense*, construed as the intuitions delivered by sensibility
    [-@allison2004, 279]. For further criticism of Allison's position
    see [@vogel1993, 879-91]. Valaris [-@valaris2008], in contrast,
    argues for the lack of content in inner sense by moving from Kant's
    statements regarding subjective states (such as pains and
    pleasures) as non-representational, to the conclusion that only
    representational states are part of the subject matter of inner
    sense (3). While this is not an unreasonable inference, nothing
    about what Kant actually says requires that we take him in the
    manner Valaris suggests, and there are further reasons not to take
    him so.

[^23]: [@rosefeldt2000, 13] notes this as well. For extensive discussion
    of Kant's views on mental illness, and their relation to inner sense
    see [@frierson2009a; -@frierson2009b].

[^24]: Henry Allison [-@allison2004, 278; cf. 292], for example, explicitly
    connects Kant's position to Hume's. See also [@guyer1987,
    283-4; @dicker2004, 3, 81; @kraus2013, 18]. For a more nuanced
    approach to the issue of the self's elusiveness, focussing not on
    the issue of sensory representation of the self, but rather
    *cognition*, see [@chignell-forthcoming].

[^25]: Kant sometimes distinguishes between *intelligence* and *soul*.
    An intelligence is sometime characterized as a noumenal entity, at
    best an “object of reason” (LM-K~2~ 28:773). See also LM-M 29:926;
    Gr 4:446ff; CPrR 5:114; and LM-K~2~ 28:775. However, Kant does
    sometimes characterize the spontaneous cognizing self as an
    "intelligence" (e.g. B155, B157-58, B158n). He also sometimes
    identifies this cognizing self or intelligence as a noumenal entity
    (e.g., *Reflexionen to the first _Critique_*, 23:34, 35). Kant’s
    considered position on the difference between soul and intelligence
    (as well as the metaphysical status of and epistemological
    connections to such beings) has been an issue of dispute amongst
    commentators. See, e.g., [@allison1996, 65-6];
    [@vancleve1999, 182-3]; [@wuerth2014, 43,63-4]. Compare also early
    Kitcher -- [-@kitcher1984, 121]; [-@kitcher1990, 139-40] -- with
    later Kitcher [-@kitcher2011, 193-7]. What seems fairly clear is
    that a soul is or has necessarily a "principle of life," which Kant
    construes as a faculty for acting on the basis of representations
    (LM-D 28:682, LM-K~2~ 28:755, inter alia). Kant also allows that
    animals are alive in this sense, while lacking an intelligence, in
    his more substantive sense. See e.g., LM-L~1~ 28:275, 276, LM-L~2~
    28:594, LM-D 28:679, 690. For further discussion of life as an
    internal principle or determination of action, as opposed to an
    external physical determination see [@frierson2014, 54-6]. For
    helpful discussion of many of the above texts, along with further
    historical commentary see [@choi-manuscript]. I'm indebted to her
    paper for bringing many of these texts to my attention.

[^26]: For a contrasting position, which takes inner sense to constitute
    the basis for the *mineness* of our mental states, see
    [@valaris2008, 3]. As I see things, this is a mistake, for it
    assumes that a subject could be given in empirical introspection
    such that what is introspected is taken as belonging to the subject
    as part of themself.

[^27]: One might object here that these considerations show at best that
    there is no *de dicto* awareness of a subject. But perhaps there is
    *de re* awareness. Insofar as intuition allows for the tracking and
    responsive differential discrimination of objects then this might
    count as a form of *de re* awareness; cf.
    [@mclear2015, 104-5 and note 60]. But there is no further sense in
    which the awareness of sensory qualities in intuition extends to a
    sensory awareness of the metaphysical subject of those qualities,
    else the objections considered above would hold. For additional
    discussion of this issue see
    [@mclear2015, 97-106; -@mclear2016b, §3.2].\label{dere}

    opposed to being representations of the mind see also [@allison2004,
    279]. For criticism of Caranti's position see
    [@chignell-forthcoming, 14-15].

[^30]: Thus I'm opting to "dissolve" the problem of why inner sense
    fails to provide a subject with knowledge of time determination, as
    argued in [@vogel1993, 877]. For discussion of why this does not
    conflict with Kant's argument in the Refutation, see below.

[^31]: Note that this interpretation does not require endorsing a
    reductive phenomenalist conception of empirical objects. On the
    reading I advocate here, intuition presents to a cognizing subject
    qualities arrayed in space and time, not merely subjective "raw
    feels," which require further intellectual work to be made into
    representations of an outer (or inner) world. For further discussion
    of the issue of phenomenalism and objectivity see
    [@allais2007; -@allais2009; -@allais2015; @mclear2016b].

[^32]: See especially [@allais2015, ch. 7].

[^33]: Advocates of such an "intellectualist" position include
    [@george1981; @pereboom1988; @grune2009; @stephenson2015]. For
    criticism of the phenomenalist view these positions suggest or
    outright commit themselves to see [@allais2015, ch. 2].

[^34]: A similar distinction is employed by Allais. See, e.g.,
    [@allais2015, 154-5].

[^35]: See [@mclear2014a, 770-2]; see also [mclear-manuscript-a, §5;
    @tolley_manuscript] for further discussion.

[^36]: Kant does here appeal to the intuition of *matter*, but this is
    compatible with my point. As Kant makes clear in the *Metaphysical
    Foundations of Natural Science*, the "metaphysical" sense of
    "matter", with which he is concerned in the first *Critique* (on
    this see [@watkins1998; cf. @friedman2013, 44-5]) is one according
    to which it is explicated "not via a predicate that belongs to it
    itself as object, but only via relation to that cognitive faculty in
    which the representation can first of all be given to me,
    \[such that\] every object of the outer senses is matter" (4:481).
    In other words, every object of outer sense is matter with respect
    to outer intuition's form. 
        Moreover, in the *Prolegomena* Kant says that "all real properties
    by which we cognize bodies are mere accidents for which we lack a
    subject -- even impenetrability, which must always be conceived only
    as the effect of a force" (P 4:333-4). This suggests that we may not
    even count as *cognizing* genuinely substantial subjects. Plausibly
    though, Kant here means only to indicate that we do not have
    cognition of an *ultimate* subject, as a thing in itself.

[^37]: This point about the quantification of time according to discrete
    magnitude is compatible with thinking that the content of inner
    sense is also quantifiable in other ways, ways moreover that might
    be independent of any appeal to outer objects or outer sense. For
    one such argument see [@kraus2013]. For extensive discussion of ways
    in which quantification of inner sense depends on outer sense see
    [@friedman2013, 61-7]. For argument that it is quantity of spatially
    extended matter that is paramount in Kant's conception of substance,
    as opposed to intensive magnitude, see Kant's discussion at MFNS
    4:542 and Friedman's commentary [-@friedman2013, 315-18].

[^38]: See also Kant's discussion of introspective psychology as
    lacking the mathematizable structure necessary for proper science at
    MFNS 4:471.

[^39]: It is in this sense that the 'I' is the "substratum of all
    empirical judgments" (R5453 18:186; cf. [@allison2004, 279]). My
    interpretation contrasts sharply with that of [@valaris2008, 3], who
    argues that inner sense, not apperception, is responsible for the
    awareness of a mental state as one's own. It also contrasts with
    Allison's position that "Since inner sense has no manifold of its
    own, there are no sensible representations through which the self
    can represent itself to itself as object" [@allison2004, 279]. I
    deny the first part of this claim---inner sense *does* have its own
    "manifold"---so there are representations in inner sense that are
    the basis for representation of the self as object. However, these
    representations, just like those of outer sense, do not provide a
    subject of properties (mental states). That only happens in inner
    experience, which is the result of synthesis by the categories.
    Hence, just as with the outer objects of extrospection,
    introspection reveals an empirical subject only because of
    synthesis, which in turn depends on the grasp of a subject of
    properties in the act of self-ascribing one's representations in the
    "I think".

[^40]: For criticism of this claim see, e.g., Kitcher's disparagement of
    "synthesis watching" in [@kitcher1990, 126-7; cf. @kitcher2011, 243].

[^41]: Kitcher [-@kitcher1990, 128] makes such an accusation.

[^42]: For example, Kant claims in several places that knowledge of
    outer objects as substances requires that we have *touched* things
    and felt the filling of space that comes along with this. Kant
    states in the MFNS, for example, in the Remark to Proposition 5 of
    the Dynamics, that the awareness of repulsive force is acquired via
    the sense of touch (4:510). He also seems to endorse this position
    in the *Anthropology*, which is one of the reasons touch is the “most
    important” of the senses (7:155) and, in the anthropology lectures,
    explicitly says that touch is necessary for acquiring the concept of
    a substance (*Anthropology Friedländer* (1775/6), 25:494; cf.
    *Anthropology Mrongovius* (1784/5), 25:1242). Kant's position thus
    seems to be that we cannot even *think* of matter as filling (as
    opposed to merely occupying) space, unless we have had sensations of
    resistance, and that it is the space-filling property of matter that
    renders it *substantial*.

[^43]: Jonathan Bennett [-@bennett2001b, §309] argues that Hume's aporia
    is based on his inability to provide a "continuing substance account
    of persons" given the meagre resources of his theory. However, if I
    am correct, Hume's position is worse than this, for it isn't just
    that he cannot provide an account of a "continuing" or persistent
    substance. It is that he can provide no account, even at a time
    (i.e. synchronic unity) of the sense in which a subject is aware (at
    least potentially so) of themself as the owner of the
    representations which they self-ascribe, and thus of themself as
    *subject*. 

[^44]: That Kant believed we could be so conscious of the self as
    subject in this sense is also on display in his criticism of
    spinozism. In the Pölitz lectures on religion, Kant argues that the
    spinozist is faced with a dilemma. Since there is only one substance
    in which everything inheres either I, as subject, am this substance,
    and therefore God---which contradicts my dependence, or I am an
    accident---which contradicts my awareness of myself as subject, as
    "I" (28:1052; cf. 28:1042). See [@allison1980, 207] for relevant
    discussion.\label{spinoza}

[^45]: For a survey and defense of reading Kant as making metaphysical,
    as opposed to merely epistemological or logical claims (as is widely
    held amongst contemporary interpreters of Kant) concerning the self
    see [@marshall2010].

[^46]: For examples of this sort of position see [@bird1962, 130-1];
    [@george1981]; [@guyer1987, 11-24]; [@pereboom1988; -@pereboom2006, 160]; [@haag2007, ch. 2].

[^47]: In her discussion of this passage Stefanie Grüne
    [-@grune2009, 41] argues that there is not an intuition prior to the
    establishment of a relation between one's mental states (sensations)
    and a determinate object of that state. Grüne thus combines the
    position that Kant is articulating a mechanism by which mental
    states gain intentional content, which I deny, with the point that I
    have argued for---viz. that the senses present only qualities. For
    criticism of Grüne's subjective starting point see [@mclear2016].

[^48]: Kant's position on this matter is also clear from his statement
    that the dynamical categories (relation and modality) apply
    necessarily only to *experience* and not unconditionally to
    *intuition*. The mathematical categories (of extensive and intensive
    magnitude) are the only categories that apply "apodictically" to
    intuition (A160-1/B199-200; see also A178-80/B220-3). 

[^49]: For extensive treatment of this issue in philosophical work
    throughout the late medieval period see [@pasnau2013a].<!-- TODO:
    Add citations to other early modern figures -->

[^50]: Karl Ameriks [-@ameriks2000a, 67] argues that the A-edition first
    Paralogism fails to provide any non-spurious argument against the
    status of soul as a noumenal substance. I agree with Ameriks that
    Kant does not argue against the status of the soul as a substance,
    but deny that he ever intends to do so. His main aim concerns the
    claim that we could have knowledge of the *permanence* of the soul,
    which he consistently denies. For a similar position see
    [@wuerth2014, 166-7].

[^51]: Here Stephen Engstrom [-@engstrom2013, 52-3] disagrees, arguing
    that "I cannot identify the I of original apperception with myself
    as an individual person or as one subject distinguished from other
    possible subjects" (52). He justifies this claim by the fact that
    apperception in §16 of the B-Deduction is "pure, not empirical" (52)
    and thus contains the formal ground for any particular 'I' but not a
    particular 'I' (viz. *me*, as thinker) itself. If the argument of
    the present paper is correct then this position is mistaken. There
    could be no empirical presentation of a subject in intuition,
    because intuition provides only properties. Therefore, there is only
    one way to be aware of oneself as subject -- i.e. as think*er* --
    and that is via (non-empirical) pure apperception. Engstrom thus
    saddles Kant with a problem he does not in fact have---viz.
    concerning how one moves from such a "formal 'I'" to the particular
    'I' that is oneself. It is not obvious to me how this problem is
    answered on Engstrom's interpretation. It seems we can avoid the
    problem altogether by noting that while pure apperception involves
    an awareness of the self absent any predicate, this is compatible
    with one's awareness being of *oneself*, since, as has been much
    discussed in the philosophy of mind, self-ascription need not
    involve any appeal to identifying information, on pain of regress.
    For discussion see, e.g. [@shoemaker1988; -@shoemaker1994a, 257-8].
    
[^52]: For a similar point see [@wuerth2014, 167-8].

[^53]: Note that I make no claim here concerning how the cognizing
    subject determines, for any given quality or cluster of qualities
    presented in sense, which are the accidents and which the substance.
    It may well depend on the cognizer's ability to distinguish one or
    more predicates as more stable with respect to others (e.g.
    impenetrability vs. color), and of some concepts as reciprocially
    interchangeable (e.g. `<body>` and `<divisible>`). For discussion of
    these issues see [@longuenesse1998, 327-30; @rosefeldt2000, 33-5].
    However, I disagree with Longuenesse's claim that "the concept of
    substance has no other meaning than that of being the referent of
    the term x to which all concepts of real determinations are
    attributed in judgment" [-@longuenesse1998, 331]. This makes the
    concept of substance too much the thin grammatical version of the
    Metaphysical Deduction. 

[^54]: [@ameriks2000a, 69-70].

[^55]: For one sketch of how a kantian metaphysics of the self could be
    fleshed out in terms of something other than a single substance see
    [@marshall2010, §4]. However, there may well be practical grounds on
    which Kant thinks we could have cognition of the self as substance,
    particularly in terms of its freedom, activity, and moral status.
    For discussion see, e.g. [@schafer2014a; -@schafer2015].

[^56]: [@wuerth2014, 169] attempts to address this problem by means of
    an appeal to Kant's Virgil argument, asserting that *multiple*
    substances could *not* together have unified thoughts characteristic
    of a single subject employing the first-person concept. Even if we
    allow that this is true (though Kant's criticism of the "Virgil" or
    "Achilles" argument at A352-3 tells against this), it does not
    resolve the real problem at issue, which is how we can know that we
    are substances rather than accidents. Wuerth does, however, point
    out the compatibility of Kant's view with our being *dependent*
    substances; see [@wuerth2014, 170-1, cf. 85]. Wuerth also argues,
    concerning a passage from ML~2~ discussing Spinoza and addressed
    above in note \ref{spinoza}, that Kant denies the coherence of
    considering the self as an accident of another substance. This seems
    correct. Unfortunately, the dating of the lecture notes is to
    1783/4, and the issue that Ameriks raises are prompted by statements
    Kant makes in the B-edition of 1787. This doesn't show that Kant
    changes his mind (and his later notes suggest that he does not). But
    it may suggest that Kant denies that we could, on the basis of the
    testimony of consciousness, *cognize* or *know* that we are not
    accidents of the single world-substance.

[^57]: There is a further issue as to whether the immediate awareness of
    one's own mental acts entails that we better know the *nature* of
    the mind as opposed to body. Malebranche famously criticizes
    Descartes on this issue. For discussion see
    [@schmaltz1996, ch. 2; @lolordo2005; @nolan2005b; @jolley2009]

[^58]: Kant may in fact think that we are *required* to take ourselves
    as substances insofar as we take our mental states to be accidents
    inhering in us as metaphysical subjects. Kant may think that it is
    incoherent for an accident to itself have accidents. 

[^59]: A further issue, which I do not address here, concerns Kant's
    evolving views regarding singular concepts. By the time of the first
    *Critique* Kant no longer believes that we have any genuinely
    singular concepts, in the Leibnizian sense, but rather only concepts
    that are singular in *use*; e.g. WL 24:910-11; PL 24:569; JL 9:91,
    97; B683-4. See also [@thompson1972]; [@longuenesse1998, 247-8];
    [@rosefeldt2000, 39-42; -@rosefeldt2003, 144].

[^60]: Kant comments extensively on the relation between a substance and
    its accidents in the Herder lectures. For discussion see
    [@watkins2005, ch. 2]. And as Watkins [-@watkins2005, ch. 6] makes
    clear, Kant's conception of substances as possessing powers
    continues into the critical period and is integral to the argument
    of the Analogies. 

[^61]: See also R5861 18:371 (1783-4). For discussion see
    [@longuenesse1998, 331-2 and note 17]; [@rosefeldt2000, 38 and note 59]). One
    means of downplaying Kant's appeals to a cognizing subject of such
    accidents is to argue that the existence of cognitive powers does
    not, for Kant, imply the existence of a metaphysical subject.
    [@kitcher1990] presents one such argument by attempting to
    contextualize Kant's view as accepting several Humean premises,
    including a "bundle view" of the self. For criticism of the
    plausibility of Kitcher's position see
    [@allison1990, ch. 4; @wuerth2006; @wuerth2014, ch. 1].

[^62]: Kant was not the first to argue that self-consciousness is
    fundamental in this way. For discussion of the intellectual context
    of Kant's claims concerning apperception see
    [@thiel1997; -@thiel2001]. Of particular note is Thiel's discussion
    of Johann Berhard Merian in [@thiel1996]. As he notes there, Merian
    is the first to utilize the phrase "original apperception" and also
    construes "apperception" in a way which bears at least some
    similarity to Kant's usage. I disagree with Thiel, however, in his
    statement that Kant, like Merian, does not utilze a notion of the
    self as a mental substance in the account of pure apperception. See
    [@thiel2001, 476]. As we will see below, rather than denying the
    awareness of the self as a metaphysical subject, Kant rather
    carefully tries to thread his way between the excesses of rational
    psychology and the rather austere position typically attributed to
    him.

[^63]: Kant, in the *Anthropology* also contrasts the "feeling of self"
    [*Selbstgefühl*] possessed by the infant with the use of the
    first-person pronoun. "When [the child] starts to speak by means of
    'I' a light seems to dawn on him, as it were...Before he merely felt
    himself, now he thinks himself" (An 7:127). Thus Kant rejects what,
    in contemporary discussion of this issue, has been called the
    "Uniformity Thesis" regarding self-knowledge. See, e.g.,
    [@boyle2009a, 141]; cf. [@shoemaker1988]; [@burge1996;
    -@burge2013b]; [@moran2001]. Boyle [-@boyle2009a], however,
    attributes to Kant the view that it is in inner sense that we are
    aware of ourselves as subjects (see p. 142, note 12), whereas I
    distinguish inner sense, as a form of intuiting, from pure
    apperception.

[^64]: For further discussion of Kant's views in the *Dissertation* and
    their relation to Kant's subsequently evolving views in the 1770's
    see [@dyck2016]. For speculation that Kant is influenced in his view
    here by his reading of Leibniz see [@allison2015, 59].

[^65]: Of course, this is only a problem if the senses are our only
    means of access to reality. As we will see, Descartes, Leibniz, and
    the pre-critical Kant all deny this.

[^66]: As mentioned in note \ref{dere} above, this is compatible with
    intuition's allowing for *de re* psychological states concerning the subject.

[^67]: Thanks to [...] Special thanks to Colin Marshall and Yoon Choi
    for their extensive comments and helpful discussion.

[^68]: One might object here that similar worries could be raised
    concerning the other categories, and particularly the relational
    categories. While this may be true, it does not seem to be an
    object, but perhaps evidence as to why Kant would hold that the
    categories are derived from the principle of apperception (B142),
    and would further cement my claim that pure apperception is playing
    an analogous role in the critical period (albeit suitably pared of
    much of its metaphysical excess) as intuition of the subject played
    in the 1770's. 

[^69]: Note that the issue is one concerning the *source* of the
    representational content, not the justification of applying the
    concept. I take it that the issue of justification is the "quid
    juris" question with which the Transcendental Deduction is
    concerned. The question I pursue here is more along the lines of the
    "quid facti" presupposed by much of the argument of the Deduction. 

[^70]: It is nevertheless compatible with the concept of a substance, so
    understood, that it *does* depend on something else. Descartes and
    Leibniz, for example, both consider finite substance to depend on
    the activity of God. What they deny is the claim that this
    dependence relation be understood in the same terms as the inherence
    relation. 

[^71]: Descartes is another obvious proponent of the importance of
    self-knowledge for knowledge of nature. For Descartes, all knowledge
    of substance is purely intellectual, as is indicated by his famous
    'wax argument' in the *Second Meditation*. As he puts it, “when I
    distinguish the wax from its outward forms - take the clothes off,
    as it were, and consider it naked” (CSM II:22; AT VII:32) then what
    is grasped purely intellectually is the nature of the wax as an
    enduring thing with determinable features (consisting of being
    extended, flexible, and changeable (CSM II:20; AT VII:31)), and
    possessing a particular modal profile (of taking on “countless”
    possible forms (CSM II:21; AT VII:31)). Descartes argues that “the
    perception I have of it [the wax] is a case not of vision or touch
    or imagination - nor has it ever been, despite previous
    appearances - but of purely mental scrutiny” (CSMII:21; AT VII:31).
    He also says in the *Third Meditation* that, “[m]y understanding of
    what a thing is, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive
    simply from my own nature” (CSMII:26; AT VII:38). For further
    discussion along these lines see [@pasnau2013a, 139]. For objections
    to this reading see [@williams1978, 220-1];
    [@carriero2009, 440, note 32]; cf. [@morris2014].

    the categories from apperception, but does so successfully, if not
    fully explicitly, in the first *Critique*, see [@schulting2012a]. I
    make no such strong claims here. 

[^175136]: It is also interesting to note here that in Kant's notes for
    a deduction in the 1770s, of the three "titles of the understanding"
    with which he is concerned, two are relational categories (i.e.
    cause-effect, and substance). See [@guyer1987]; [@carl1989a,
