# Kant's Deduction(s)
    
## The Forms of Judgment[^214958]

[^214958]: If we abstract from all content of a judgment in general, and attend only to the mere form of the understanding in it, we find that the function of thinking in that can be brought under four titles, each of which contains under itself three moments" (A70/B95).

\includegraphics[height=81mm, width=90mm]{/Users/Roambot/Dropbox/Work/Teaching/KantSurvey/KantJudge.jpeg}

- Every judgment yields a "unity" (i.e. a propositional form) corresponding to the moments of the four types of judgment
    - Every judgment takes one moment from each group
        - universal, affirmative, categorical and assertoric (‘all crows are black’) 
        - singular, negative, disjunctive and problematic (‘that bird might be neither a crow nor a raven’)
- Kant thinks that the 12 forms constitute all logically coherent cognitive acts which the understanding might engage in
- Kant also assumes that the only possible employment of concepts is in judgment[^3]
    - this is how the forms of judgment provide a 'clue' to nature of the categories
    - they only provide a 'clue' however, because the forms of judgment are *formal* and thus lack any precise content --- they thus cannot by themselves determine the content of the categories

## The Forms of Thought – The 'Categories'  

- The categories provide a dual role --- they organize both intuition and concepts[^18]
    - the dual role of the categories plus their connection to the forms of judgment yields (according to Kant) a determinate content---viz. the precise list of categories Kant provides

\includegraphics[height=71mm, width=90mm]{/Users/Roambot/Dropbox/Work/Teaching/KantSurvey/KantCats.jpeg}

## Problems ##

- Completeness: Kant presents his table of judgment as if it were complete, but
  it seems ad hoc or arbitrary[^105532]
- Derivation: Kant claims that the all and only the categories may be
  completely derived from the table of judgment but give no such derivation
    + are the categories just *identical* with the forms of judgment?

[^105532]: This division is systematically generated from a common principle," namely the faculty for judging (which is the same as the faculty for thinking), and has not arisen rhapsodically from a haphazard search for pure concepts, of the completeness of which one could never be certain, since one would only infer it through induction, without reflecting that in this way one would never see why just these and not other concepts should inhabit the pure understanding. (A80-1/B106-7)

# On Synthesis (§10)

- A form of mental activity
    - Kant sometimes discusses synthesis as an 'act' [*Handlung*] but this is mildly misleading, as it may suggest that synthesis is a form of intentional action rather than an (at least sometimes involuntary) activity of the mind of which the subject may or may not be aware[^8]
- Synthesis works on representations by "running through" and "gathering together" discrete representations into one combined and connected whole (A99)
    - Is synthesis a causal process?
        - No? --- would seem to be incompatible with deterministic world
        - Yes? --- realism about intentional states suggests that they have causal powers, and that the causal features and interactions between such states are what provide them with representational content and allow them to track logical relationships[^9]
- All cognition demands a synthesis of representation[^19]
- Synthesis is carried out by the unitary subject of representation on representations that are either given to it in sensibility (i.e. intuition) or produced by it in thought (e.g. stipulative conceptual definition)
    - What Kant will attempt to show in the Deduction is that "experience" (in some sense of that term) depends on synthesis via application of the categories
- Two kinds of synthesized representations
    - concepts
        - combination of concepts in one judgment
        - combination of simpler concepts into a more complex concept (cf. A729/B757; Logik Pölitz 24:568)
    - the 'manifold' of intuition (either in one intuition or many)
        - combination of sensations in one intuition (?)
            - this claim is controversial, as it suggests that intuition is constructed via synthesis
        - combination of intuitions into a complex intuition

[^8]: [synthesis] is a mere effect of the of the imagination, a blind
though indispensible function of the soul...of which we are only seldom
even conscious (A78/B103)

[^9]: It's not just that, in a psychology of propositional attitudes,
content and causal powers are attributed to the same things. It's also
that causal relations among propositional attitudes somehow typically
contrive to respect their relations of content, and belief/desire
explanations often turn on this. Hamlet believed that somebody had
killed his father because he believed that Claudius had killed his
father. His having the second belief explains his having the first.
How? Well, presumably via some such causal generalization as 'if
someone believes Fa, then ceteris paribus he believes $\exists$x(Fx).' This
generalization specifies a causal relation between two kinds of mental
states picked out by reference to (the logical form of) the propositions
they express...(@fodor1987, 12)

# The Task of the Deduction

- Demonstrate the legitimacy of the categories
    - legitimacy understood in terms of concepts which have their source in the mind (i.e. the categories) but which are correctly and justifiably applied to features present in experience
    - the "transcendental" nature of the argument is characterized as an argument which begins from obvious or uncontroversial premises and argues to some conclusion understood as a necessary condition for the possibility of the truth of those premises
    - Kant's use of '*Deduktion*' redeploys German legal vocabulary; in Holy Roman Empire Law, 'Deduktion' signifies an argument intended to yield a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property claim 
        - In Kant's usage a deduction is an argument that aims to justify the use of a concept, one that demonstrates that the concept correctly applies to objects
    - the demonstration of their legitimacy proceeds by appealing to the necessary role of the categories in coming to have empirical *cognition* [*Erkenntniss*] of any sort
        - confusingly, Kant often elides this notion of empirical cognition with the notion of "Experience" [*Erfahrung*]

## Grades of 'Experience'

- Kant's usage of 'experience' [*Erfahrung*] is ambiguous throughout his work[^99][^11]
    - (e1) having sensations
    - (e2) having sensations and being conscious of them
    - (e3) having intuitions
    - (e4) having intuitions and conceptualizing them (bringing them under
    concepts)
    - (e5) having intuitions and conceptualizing them by means of physical-object concepts
    - (e6) having intuitions and conceptualizing them as mine 
    - (e7) having intuitions and making judgments about them 
    - (e8) having intuitions and knowing propositions about them

# The Structure of the Deduction

- Introduction (§§13-14)
- The problem of combination (§15)
- The first step (§§16-20)
- The second step (§§21-26)

## Introduction

- §13 On The Principles Of A Transcendental Deduction As Such  
    - Discussion of a need for a transcendental as opposed to a merely empirical deduction. 
    - This is based on the fact that an empirical deduction is unavailable due to two reasons – viz. 
        (i) the a priori nature of the categories 
        (ii) their semantic content includes notions of necessity and universality (A91-2/B124)

- §14 Transition To The Transcendental Deduction Of The Categories  
    - Discussion of the nature of empirical cognition as a complex of intuition and concept (A92-3/B125) 
    - The categories are a necessary condition for the empirical cognition of objects – i.e. are necessary conditions for occurrence of thought about objects (of experience) (A93/B125-6)
    - Presents so called 'Objective' Deduction:[^12]

\newthought{The 'Objective' Deduction}

1. The experience of an object has both an intuitional and a conceptual component.[^2][^6]
2. The conceptual component can occur only if the categories apply to the object.
3. $\therefore$ The categories apply to all objects of experience.

- Premise (2) is based on the assumption of the soundness of Kant's argument in the Metaphysical Deduction---viz. that the categories are necessary for any judgment whatsoever
    i. Concepts are applied only in judgment
    ii. The categories are necessary for the application of any concept in judgment
    iii. $\therefore$ The categories are necessary for any conceptually structured mental state



\newthought{The 'Subjective' Deduction}

- The 'Subjective' Deduction is some or all of the Transcendental Deduction proper (§§15-26)
    - sets up a problem (the problem of combination)
    - shows how the categories are necessary for the resolution of that problem

## The Problem of Combination (§15)

- §15 On the possibility of a combination as such
    - what does Kant mean by 'combination' [*Verbindung*]\footnote[][-2.2in]{All
      combination (\emph{conjunctio}) is either composition
      (\emph{compositio}) or connection (\emph{nexus}). The former is the
      synthesis of a manifold of what does not necessarily belong to each
      other\ldots{}The second combination (nexus) is the synthesis of that
      which is manifold insofar as they necessarily belong to one
      another\ldots{}(B201-2)}
    - why can't combination be given in intuition?\footnote[][-1.2in]{the
      combination (\emph{conjunctio}) of a manifold in general can never come
      to us through the senses, and therefore cannot already be contained in
      the pure form of sensible intuition; for it is an act of the spontaneity
      of the power of representation...we can represent nothing as combined in
      the object without having previously combined it ourselves, and that
      among all representations \textbf{combination} is the only one that is
      not given through objects but can be executed only by the subject
      itself, since it is an act of its self-activity. (B129-30)}
    - what is the connection of the categories with combination?[^7]
    




## The First Step (§§16-20)

- The primary goal of the first step is to demonstrate the truth of a conditional claim---viz. if there is cognition then the categories must play a role in its generation
    - §16 On the original synthetic unity of apperception
    - §17 The principle of the synthetic unity of apperception is the supreme principle for all use of the understanding
    - §18 What objective unity of self-consciousness is
    - §19 The logical form of all judgments consists in the objective unity of apperception of the concepts contained in them
    - §20 All sensible intuitions are subject to the categories, which are conditions under which alone their manifold can come together in one consciousness

## The Second Step (§§21-26)

- The second step has two aims:
    i. articulate the limited application of the categories in *cognition*---viz. they may be used only within the bounds of sensible experience
    ii. demonstrate the actuality of cognitions in which the categories are applied (i.e. the antecedent of the conditional proven in the first step)
- The second step has six sections:
    - §21 Comment
    - §22 A category cannot be used for cognizing things except when it is applied to objects of experience
    - §23 [A commentary on §22]
    - §24 On applying the categories to objects of the senses as such
    - §25 [Commentary on §24, specifically intuition of the self]
    - §26 Transcendental deduction of the universally possible use in experience of the pure concepts of understanding
    



# Empirical v. Rational Psychology #

- Empirical psychology is concerned with what may be learned via inner
  observation of one's mental states[^153831]
- Rational psychology concerns what may be deduced from the a priori knowledge of oneself as a *thinking subject*[^15386]
    + provides knowledge of the essence or nature of thinking beings in general
    + provides knowledge of objects that are not objects of a possible
      experience

[^153831]: If more than the *cogito* were the ground of our pure rational cognition of thinking beings in general; if we also made use of observations
about the play of our thoughts and the natural laws of the thinking self created from them: then an empirical psychology would arise (A347/B405)

[^15386]: **I think** is thus the sole text of rational psychology, from which it is to develop its entire wisdom...because the least empirical predicate would corrupt the rational purity and independence of the science from all experience. (A343/B401)

# The Aims of the Dialectic #

- Critique of traditional metaphysics/metaphysical reasoning
- Articulation of the root of metaphysical error
    + The role of reason in metaphysical error
        * Transcendental Illusion
        * The 'Ideas of Reason'

# Transcendental (Dialectical) Illusion #

- The intellectual illusion that we have access to non-sensible objects---viz. God, the soul, and the world-whole[^20553]
    + Principles that are only legitimately applied to objects of a possible experience are applied outside the context of any possible experience, as if they were nevertheless legitimate
- Transcendental Illusion is an unavoidable product of our reason[^20129]

[^20129]: The cause of this is that in our reason (considered subjectively as a human faculty of cognition) there lie fundamental rules and maxims for its use, which look entirely like objective principles, and through them it comes about that the subjective necessity of a certain connection of our concepts on behalf of the understanding is taken for an objective necessity,the determination of things in themselves. [This is] an illusion that cannot be avoided at all. (A297-B353-4)

[^20553]: **transcendental illusion** [contains principles] which instead, contrary to all the warnings of criticism, carries us away beyond the empirical use of the categories, and holds out to us the semblance of extending the pure understanding. (A295/B352)

## Reason & Explanation (Reason in its 'logical use') ##

- The three faculties
    + Sensibility provides the material for concepts & judgments
    + Understanding generates concepts and judgments from what is given in sensibility
    + The faculty of reason aims to connect judgments in inferential chains (syllogisms)
- Reason seeks to *explain* what is given to it by the understanding[^91247]
- Two uses of reason 
    + *Descending*
        * movement from condition to conditioned
        + subsuming objects of cognition under general principles 
    + *Ascending*
        * movement from conditioned to condition
        * articulating general principles under which objects of cognition may be subsumed
        * Reason seeks the condition for anything that is given to it until it finds the *unconditioned* condition of everything
        * Reason seeks to *unify* cognition, so as to subsume the largest number of objects of cognition under the smallest number of principles[^10381]

[^10381]: reason, in inferring, seeks to bring the greatest manifold of cognition of the understanding to the smallest number of principles (universal conditions), and thereby to effect the highest unity of that manifold. (A305/B361)

[^91247]: what is unique to reason on Kant’s view is that it demands a complete
explanation for given facts. The function of reason is not to generate
experience in the first place, which is the task of the understanding working
together with sensibility (A307/B363–4). Instead, ... judgments about
experience are the starting points or input for reason. Reason’s basic function
is to ask about any given empirical judgment: *why*? Moreover, once reason
finds an answer to this question, it subjects that answer in turn to the same
question: *why*? (@rohlf2010, 195)

# A Critique of Pure Reason #

- Reason's demand for the unconditioned condition of everything causes it to illegitimately apply logical principles in a metaphysical way
- Kant critiques reason in its 'pure' (a priori/real/non-logical) use -- we can have no knowledge through reason alone, but only the illusion of knowledge[^201440]

[^201440]: the question is: Does reason in itself, i.e., pure reason, contain a priori synthetic principles and rules, and in what might such principles consist? (A306/B363)

## Transcendental Ideas (Reason in its 'real use') ##

Idea: a concept made of up notions, which goes beyond the possibility of experience (A320/B377)

 + Reason produces its own concepts
    + Assumes the existence of supersensible objects of those concepts
        * Assumes that we can have synthetic a priori knowledge of such objects[^202710]

[^202710]: this logical maxim [to find the condition for a given conditioned
claim] cannot become a principle of **pure reason** unless we assume that when
the conditioned is given, then so is the whole series of conditions
subordinated one to the other, which is itself unconditioned, also given (i.e.,
contained in the object and its connection). Such a principle of pure reason,
however, is obviously **synthetic**; for the conditioned is analytically
related to some condition, but not to the unconditioned. (A307-8/B364)

\newthought{The three transcendental ideas of reason:}[^203248]

[^203248]: There will be as many concepts of reason as there are species of relation represented by the understanding by means of the categories; and so we must seek an **unconditioned**, **first**, for the **categorical** synthesis in a **subject**, **second** for the **hypothetical** synthesis of the members of a **series**, and **third** for the disjunctive synthesis of the parts in a **system**. (A323/B379)

1. Psychology: the conditions of the unity of the subject
    + The soul
2. Cosmology: the conditions of unity of the series of appearances
    + The world whole (or cosmos)
3. Theology: the absolute unity of the conditions of all objects in general
    + God

# Problems #

## Some Objections ##

- Reason's two 'parts' in ascending and descending, lack unity
    + Ascending reason is non-inferential
    + Descending reason is purely inferential
        * Kant's focus on syllogism and on categorical syllogism in particular threatens the generality of his claims
- There is no clear distinction between the understanding and reason
    + Understanding 'ascends' and 'descends' too
        * Reply: focus on the kinds of 'unities' that result from the activities of the distinct faculties[^111432]
- Is transcendental illusion really *necessary*?
    + Does Kant's position merely reflect the interests of German philosophy at his time?        


[^111432]: If the understanding may be a faculty of the unity of appearances by means of rules, then reason is the faculty of the unity of the rules of the understanding under principles. (A302/B358-9)

## Worries About Derivation ##

- What is Kant's route to the specific ideas of the soul, cosmos, and God?[^133717]
    + Connection between the forms of syllogism, the categories of relation, and the ideas seems *arbitrary*, or at least artificial

[^133717]: Now what is universal in every relation that our representations can have is (1) the relation to the subject, (2) the relation to objects, and indeed either as appearances or as objects of thinking in general. If we combine this subdivision with the above division, then all the relation of representations of which we can make either a concept or an idea are of three sorts: (1) the relation to the subject, (2) to the manifold of the object in appearance, and (3) to all things in general...The thinking subject is the object of psychology, the sum total of appearances (the world) is the object of cosmology, and the thing that contains the supreme condition of the possibility of everything that can be thought (the being of all beings) is the object of theology. (A333–4/B390–1)

            * simplicity
            * unity/identity
            * relation to spatial objects
    + Hypothetical (the cosmos)

            + Physico-theological argument (argument from design)





# Reason as Regulative #

- The ideas of reason can have a positive use by acting as maxims for theory
  construction and the creation of a unified theory of
  nature\footnote[][-3in]{This unity is, of course, only a `projected' unity
  (A647/B675), a mere ideal, but it has significance for how we approach the
  empirical world. Kant gives the following illustrations: under pressure from
  reason, we will search for fundamental (chemical) elements and powers in
  nature (A646/B674, A648--9/B676--7), employ concepts of ideal entities not
  to be found in nature (e.g.~pure earth, water and air, A646/B674), develop
  hypotheses advancing universal laws of nature (A646--7/B674--5) and classify
  the organic and inorganic natural worlds into genera and species
  (A653--7/B681--5). The operative maxims are the three principles of
  `genera', `specification' and `affinity', instructing us to seek out
  respectively `homogeneity', `variety' and `continuity' among natural forms
  (A651--64/B679--92). (Gardner 1999, 144)}
- Reason lacks a 'constitutive' use in that it has no genuine objects, other than what may be given to it by the understanding (A643-4/B671-2)
- The error of traditional metaphysics is thus to mistake a 'regulative'
  principle for a 'constitutive' one\footnote[][-1in]{the transcendental ideas
  are never of constitutive use, so that the concepts of certain objects would
  thereby be given, and in case one so understands them, they are merely
  sophistical (dialectical) concepts...however, they have an excellent and
  indispensably necessary regulative use...of directing the understanding
  (A644/672)}

# The Paralogisms #

- Instance of Transcendental Illusion
- All paralogisms are syllogistic inferences[^122958] with three distinguishing characteristics
    +   fallacious categorical syllogism exhibiting an error of equivocation between the major premise and the minor premise[^16611] 
    +   formally invalid but has true premises[^15588]
    +   as an instance of TI, must be a plausible and compelling error

1. All M are P—major premise 
2. S is M—minor premise 
3. $\therefore$ S is P—conclusion

[^122958]: All basic syllogisms consist of three categorical sentences (e.g. 'S is P'), in which the two premises share exactly one term, called the 'middle term', and the conclusion contains the other two terms, sometimes called the 'extremes'. The 'major' premise is general, the 'minor' premise singular. The 'major' and 'minor' terms figure in their respective premises.

[^16611]: [A paralogism] arises when the middle concept is taken in different senses in the two premises—when, namely, the *logical* relation (in thinking) in one of the premises is taken as a real one (of the objects of intuition) in the other. (R 5552; 18:218; cf. A402 and B411)

[^15588]: A **paralogism** is a syllogistic inference that is false as far as its form is concerned, although as far as its matter (the antecedent propositions) are concerned [*bei Vordersätzen*], it is correct. (R 5552; 18:218)

# The First Paralogism -- Substantiality #

## A-edition Version (A348)

1. That which is the subject of judgment and cannot be predicated of anything
   else is substance.
2. I, as a thinking being, am the **absolute subject** of all my possible
   judgments, and this representation of Myself cannot be used as the predicate
   of any other thing.
3. $\therefore$ I, as thinking being (soul), am **substance**.

\newthought{Problems}:

- Premise (1) is not a major premise but rather a definition
- Premise (2) is not sufficiently general

\newthought{Proop's Revision}:

1. Entities whose representation cannot be used as a determination of other things are substances. (All S is P)
2. The self is an entity whose representation cannot be used as a predicate of another thing. (M is S)
3. $\therefore$ The self is a substance. (M is P)

- Premises are plausibly true
    + \(1) is a definition
    + \(2) is true insofar as 'I' cannot figure in the predicate place of a possible judgment
- Problem: not clearly a paralogism
    + valid & sound if 'determination' is read as 'predicate'
    + notion of 'substance' is merely grammatical -- a claim about a representation's use

Substance~0~:
:   x is a substance~0~ iff the representation of x cannot be used as a predicate in a categorical judgment

- Kant needs a better definition of 'substance' such that a genuine paralogism results

## B-edition Version (B410-11)

1. What cannot be thought otherwise than as subject does not exist otherwise
   than as subject, and is therefore substance.[^161233]: 
2. Now a thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be thought
   otherwise than as subject.
3. $\therefore$ A thinking being also exists only as such a thing, i.e., as
   substance.

[^161233]: 'does not' should read 'cannot'?



\newthought{Proop's Revision}:

1. All entities that cannot be thought otherwise than as subjects are entities that cannot exist otherwise than as subjects, and therefore (by definition) are substances. (All M are P)
2. All entities that are thinking beings (considered merely as such) are entities that cannot be thought otherwise than as subjects. (All S are M)
3. $\therefore$ All entities that are thinking beings (considered merely as such) are entities that cannot exist otherwise than as subjects, and therefore are substances (All S are P)

- Invalid inference because of an equivocation in the use of 'thought'[^13236]
    + Premise (1) treats 'thought' as 'conception'
        + claims that the inconceivability of something as a property/mode entails that it cannot exist as a property/mode
    + Premise (2) treats 'thought' as 'a representation used as the predicate of a possible judgment'
- The 'logical' use of 'I' is mistaken for a 'real' use in denoting a purely intellectually graspable, 'unschematized' conception of substance.[^154929]
    + Substance~1~: a being whose existence is such that it can never *inhere*
      in anything else[^15028][^15459]
        * concept of substance~1~ is logically consistent but may be 'really repugnant'
        * we should remain agnostic as to whether there are any substances~1~
    + (Empirical) Substance~2~: a being that persists at every moment
      (A144/B183, A182)

[^13236]: ‘Thought’ [*Das Denken*] is taken in an entirely different meaning [*Bedeutung*] in the two premises: in the major premise, as it applies to an object in general (hence as it may be given in intuition); but in the minor premise only as it subsists in relation to self-consciousness, where, therefore, no object is thought, but only the relation to oneself as subject (as the form of thinking) is represented. (footnote, B 411-12)

[^15459]: the I that I think can always be considered as **subject**, and as something that does not depend on thinking merely as a predicate...does not signify that I as **object** am for myself a **self-subsisting being** or **substance**. (B407)

[^15028]: something can exist only as **subject**, not as mere determination of other things, i.e., can be substance (B288)

[^154929]: the first syllogism of transcendental psychology imposes on us an only allegedly new insight when it passes off the constant logical subject of thinking as the cognition of a real subject of inherence, with which we do not and cannot have the least acquaintance, because consciousness is the one single thing that makes all representations into thoughts, and in which, therefore, as in the transcendental subject, our perceptions must be encountered; and apart from this logical significance of the I, we have no acquaintance with the subject in itself that grounds this I as a substratum, just as it grounds all thoughts.

[^1]: Now we will set the necessary connection of the understanding with
the appearances by means of the categories before our eyes by beginning
from beneath, namely with what is empirical. The first thing that is
given to us is appearance, which, if it is combined with consciousness,
is called perception (A 119)

[^2]: There are two conditions under which alone the cognition of an
object is possible: first, intuition, through which it is given ... ;
secondly, concept, through which an object is thought corresponding to
this intuition. (A92-93/B125)

    Now all experience does indeed contain, in addition to the intuition
of the senses through which something is given, a concept of an object
as being thereby given. (A93/B126)

[^3]: "the understanding can make no other use of...concepts than that of judging by means of them. (A68/B93)

[^6]: For a representation to be a cognition (though here I mean always
a theoretical one), we need to have concept and intuition of an object
combined in the same representation, so that the former is represented
as containing the latter under itself. (*Progress*, 20:273-4)

[^7]: Now the representation of a composite, as such, is not a mere intuition,
but requires the concept of a compounding, so far as it is applied to the
intuition in space and time. So this concept...is one that is not abstracted
from intuitions...but is a basic concept, and a priori at that...There will
thus be as many a priori concepts resident in the understanding, to which
objects given to the senses must be subordinated, as there are types of
compounding (*synthesis*) with consciousness, i.e., as there are types of
synthetic unity of apperception of the manifold given in intuition.
(*Progress*, 20:271)


[^99]: In the first paragraph of the introduction to the work,
Kant uses 'experience' in two different senses without calling the
reader's attention to the fact. The experience with which all our
knowledge is said to begin is "the raw material of the sensible
impressions"; experience in this sense is then said to be worked
up by the understanding into "that knowledge of objects which is
entitled experience" (Bl). The same ambiguity runs throughout the work.

[^10]: The I think must be able to accompany all my representations; for
otherwise something would be represented in me that could not be thought
at all, which is as much as to say that the representation would either
be impossible or else at least would be nothing for me. (B131-2)

[^11]: Empirical cognition, however, is experience (B166).
    Experience is an empirical cognition, i.e., a cognition that determines an object through perceptions (A176/B218).
    Therefore experience itself – i.e., empirical cognition of appearances – is possible only in as much as we subject the succession of appearances, and hence all change, to the law of causality (A189/B234).

[^12]: This inquiry, which goes rather deep, has two sides. One side
refers to the objects of the pure understanding, and is supposed
to demonstrate and make comprehensible the objective validity of
its concepts a priori; thus it belongs essentially to my ends. The
other side deals with the pure understanding itself, concerning its
possibility and the powers of cognition on which it itself rests; thus
it considers it in a subjective relation (Axvi-xvii)

[^13]: a judgment is nothing other than the way to bring given cognitions to the objective unity of apperception (B141)

[^14]: This, then, is the central thesis of sensationism: that there are
non-intentional mental states in which no object, other than the state
itself, is present to the mind, and that they are the foundations of
empirical knowledge. (@george1981, 230)

[^15]: It is evident that Kant took the spatial and extended nature
of objects to be the result of an interpretation placed upon certain
sequences of sensations, which are themselves without extension.
(@george1981, 240)

[^16]: Initially only the succession of sensation is present, and we
may speak of a generation of the spatial features of objects by putting
the sensations in relation to each other, setting them "outside and
alongside each other, and referring them to something outside me" as
Kant puts it at the beginning of the Transcendental Aesthetic. The
aggregation and coordination of sensory impressions produce objects,
reference...(@george1981, 240)

[^17]: intuitions do not refer to objects, indeed they are not properly
speaking intuitions, if they are not combined with concepts, and
this can occur only in the context of a judgment: "Only if they (the
understanding and the senses, i.e. intuitions and concepts) are united
can reference result." (@george1981, 243)


[^18]: The same function that gives unity to the different
representations in a judgment also gives unity to the mere synthesis of
different representations in an intuition, which, expressed generally,
is called the pure concept of understanding. The same understanding,
therefore, and indeed by means of the very same actions through which
it brings the logical form of a judgment into concepts by means of
the analytical unity, also brings a transcendental content into its
representations by means of the synthetic unity of the manifold in
intuition in general, on account of which they are called pure concepts
of the understanding that pertain to objects a priori; this can never
be accomplished by universal logic. (A79/B105)

[^19]: By synthesis in the most general sense, however, I understand
the action of putting different representations together with each other
and comprehending their manifoldness in one cognition. Such a synthesis
is pure if the manifold is given not empirically but a priori (as is
that in space and time)...The synthesis of a manifold, however, (whether
it be given empirically or a prior) first brings forth a cognition,
which to be sure may initially still be raw and confused, and thus
in need of analysis; yet the synthesis alone is that which properly
collects the elements for cognitions and unifies them into a certain
content; it is therefore the first thing to which we have to attend
if we wish to judge about the first origin of our cognition. (A77-8/B103)
