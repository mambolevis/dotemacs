\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Kant's 1786 *Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science* (MFNS) presents a
sustained analysis and exposition of the concept `<matter>` in order to show
that *matter* (the thing) is essentially movable, fills space, possesses motive
force, and is a (possible) object of experience.[^142424]

However, as many commentators have noted, Kant's argument for the centrality
of `<motion>` in his exposition of `<matter>` appears to be at best a highly
compressed and potentially dogmatic empirical claim and at worst is wholly
specious.[^commentators] Kant argues that,

[^commentators]: Friedman [-@friedman2013, 43] calls the argument "especially
obscure and cryptic." Watkins considers it "dogmatic," and states that the
argument "hardly amounts to a satisfactory justification" of the fundamentality
of `<motion>` [-@watkins1998a, 578]. Other commentators (e.g.
[@hoppe1969, 42-43, 63-66]; [@walker1971, 123]; [@dahlstrom1991, 271-90, 285])
have taken the argument to at best show that motion is empirically necessary for
human beings to have experience.

> The fundamental determination of something [*eines Etwas*], such that it
> should be an object of the outer senses, had to be motion, because only
> thereby can these senses be affected. The understanding traces back
> [*zurückführt*] all other predicates of matter belonging to its nature
> [*Natur*] to this, and so natural science, therefore, is either a pure or
> applied *doctrine of motion*. (Preface, 4:476)

\noindent The argument attempts to show two claims. First, that the "fundamental
determination" [*Grundbestimmung*] of `<matter>` is `<motion>`. Second,
that `<motion>` is a (so to speak) "fecund" predicate, in that all of the other
determinations belonging to the nature of matter must be connected to
`<motion>`. 

[^142424]: Here and throughout I take a "determination" [*Bestimmung*] to
denote a predicate, which itself is ambiguous between a conceptual item and
the worldly feature which the concept picks out. I will use corner brackets to
indicate the concept and italics the worldly feature.

Though the argument raises many questions, in this short discussion I focus
primarily on the first claim of Kant's argument concerning the fundamentality of
`<motion>` to our concept `<matter>`. I construe Kant's argument as enthymematic
but plausibly valid, drawing on auxiliary premises that he could have easily
assumed as background to the project he outlines in the Introduction of the
MFNS. In §1 I present some initial interpretive background to the affection
argument. §2 constitutes my argument for my preferred interpretation. §3
presents some further considerations concerning the sense in which `<motion>` is
a fundamental determination of `<matter>`. 

# The Affection Argument

Kant clearly seems to think the affection argument sufficient to establish the
centrality of `<motion>` to our understanding of `<matter>`.[^21551] How does it
accomplish this task? I take the affection argument (4:476) thusly:

[^21551]: Concerning its centrality see [@watkins1998a, §2a] for discussion; cf. [@pollok2001, 149-65]. 

1.  Affection by an outer object requires motion
2.  $\therefore$ The fundamental determination of matter, as an outer object, is
    *motion*

\noindent By "fundamental determination" [*Grundbestimmung*], I take Kant to
mean here a predicate which picks out some feature that is constitutive of a
thing being the kind of thing that it is. In this case, the thing in question is
an object of the outer senses---i.e. a thing in space.[^134540]

[^134540]: This is slightly more specific than what Kant might mean, which is
merely that of an outer thing, a thing subject to principles of externality and
exclusion. Perhaps such a thing could exist without existing in space, but it
could not be an object for human beings, and perhaps not for any finite
epistemic subject. 

The notion of a "constitutive feature" is itself ambiguous between a
*metaphysically* constitutive feature---something that is part of the *essence*
of the thing, and a merely *epistemically* constitutive feature---something that
is merely part (perhaps integrally so) of our concept of it. A useful working
example of the kind of distinction I have in mind is that illustrated by the
difference between the molecular structure of water---viz. its being H~2~O---and
its stereotype---viz. a (mostly) translucent, tasteless fluid that fills rivers,
lakes, and oceans, etc.. These two notions can in principle come apart, even if
they might also coincide (partially or entirely). At this point I leave open
which notion (or perhaps both) Kant has in mind. We will return to this issue in
§3 below. 

If Kant's aim is indeed to pick out a constitutive feature of *matter* (or its
concept) then it is not immediately clear what basis he could have for choosing
*motion* and its corresponding concept. One worry, raised by a number of
commentators, is that Kant is merely stating an empirically necessary
precondition of human experience---viz. that our sense organs require excitation
via local motion for an experience to occur. Indeed, this might seem the only
way to read Kant's argument if it is to be plausible at all.[^modalmotion]
Moreover, its empirical status might seem to be required by Kant's claim, made
earlier in the introduction, that the concept `<matter>` is an empirical concept
(4:470).[^182237] Problematically for this reading, if the claim is merely an
empirical one then it is difficult to see how Kant could have thought it could
generate the requisite universality and necessity needed to ground a "pure" a
priori metaphysics of nature.[^18260]

[^modalmotion]: There is also the issue that Kant seems to regard `<motion>` as
a determination which merely *possibly* rather than *actually* applies to
matter---i.e. all matter need not actually be in motion. This point is abetted
by Kant's subsequent claim, in the Phoronomy, that matter is the movable in
space (4:480). This modal feature is not something that could be given to the
senses. See [@watkins1998a, 579]. Part of the confusion here stems from the fact
that Kant construes modal language in such a way that the modal term makes no
contribution to the content of the judgment (A74/B99-100; cf. JL 9:115). For
discussion see [@leech2012]. I shall use `<motion>` rather than `<movable>`, with
the understanding that Kant is concerned with the real possibility of an object
with this determination.

[^18260]: For this objection see [@pollok2006, 571, note 30]. 

[^182237]: See [@walker1971, 123] for this argument; cf. [@watkins1998a, 579].

This worry is a false one. Kant is not making an empirical claim concerning the
causal antecedents of human experience. He is making an a priori claim
concerning the conditions under which a finite, receptive being whose
sensibility consists of two basic forms---viz. space and time---might have
experience. Moreover, crediting Kant with making such an a priori argument does
not threaten his conception of the empirical status of the concept `<matter>`. I
take these two points in turn below.

# Change, Motion, & Affection

Kant's claim that motion is a necessary condition of affection sounds
like an empirical claim about local motion and the excitation of the senses. But
there is another possible interpretation. Kant may not be making an empirical
claim about the conditions for sensory experience, but rather an a priori claim
about the conditions under which affection is possible for beings whose outer
form of intuition is space.[^112838]

[^112838]: One might object here that this is already an empirical claim, for
the knowledge that one has an outer sense whose form is space is itself
empirical. This objection seems to confuse conditions of acquisition with
conditions of warrant. This is precisely the distinction that Kant emphasizes at
the beginning of the Introduction to the B edition of the first *Critique*
(B1-2). 

I thus take Kant's claim connecting motion and affection to depend on two
other claims that he could reasonably have assumed to be in the background to
the presentation of his project in the introduction to the MFNS. In making
good on this interpretation I shall make use of remarks Kant makes in a
variety of places other than the introduction to the MFNS. But this is an aid
to exposition of the argument only. I consider the content of the argument to
ultimately be constituted by these two background claims. The first claim
depends on his transcendental idealism, and states that all the properties of
the objects of outer sense are composed ultimately of relations, and
specifically, spatial relations. The second claim states that any change in
outer sense entails a change of spatial relations, which Kant understands as
the occurrence of a motion.

Kant's commitment to the two claims I have in mind is illustrated by his
argument in the Mechanics, Remark to Proposition 2. There he argues that  

> Matter, as mere object of the outer senses, has no other determinations except
> those of external relations in space, and therefore undergoes no change except
> by motion. With respect to the latter, as change of one motion into another,
> or of a motion into rest, or conversely, a cause must be found (by the
> principle of metaphysics). But this cause cannot be internal, for matter has
> no essentially internal determinations or grounds of determination. Hence
> every change in a matter is based on external causes (that is, a body
> persists, etc.). (MFNS: Mechanics, Remark to Proposition 2, 4:543; cf. CPR:
> Aesthetic, A49/B66-7; Amphiboly, A265/B321, A277/B333,
> A285/B341)\label{mechanics}

\noindent The passage is part of Kant's proof of the second law of
mechanics---viz. that every change in matter has an external cause (MFNS:
Mechanics, Proposition 3 4:543). In the first sentence of the quoted passage
Kant makes an inference from the determinations which matter can possess to a
conclusion concerning the nature of change in matter---viz. that it occurs via
motion. Let's examine both parts of this inference. 

Kant's first claim that, considered as an object of the outer senses, whatever
else it may be, a thing will have no other determinations than those involving
relations in space, is a wholly general one. It is not specific to his
argument in the MFNS. Instead, it is a view that Kant clearly endorses in both
the Aesthetic and the Amphiboly of the first *Critique*. Concerning what can
be given in intuition Kant says that, 

> everything in our cognition that belongs to intuition (with the exception,
> therefore, of the feeling of pleasure and displeasure and the will, which are
> not cognitions at all) contains nothing but mere relations, of places in one
> intuition (extension), alteration of places (motion), and laws in accordance
> with which this alteration is determined (moving forces). (CPR: Transcendental
> Aesthetic, A49/B66-7)

> We can cognize only pure relations in matter (that which we call their inner
> determinations is only comparatively internal); but there are among these some
> self-sufficient and persistent ones, through which a determinate object is
> given to us. (CPR: Amphiboly, A285/B341)

\noindent Kant also explicitly advocates the claim that the properties of
matter are one and all relational in the famous *Prolegomena* discussion of
all qualities or determinations of matter being "secondary" in Locke's sense
(Prolegomena: §13, Note II 4:289).[^relations] He does not seem to treat this
as an empirical discovery but rather as a position entailed by the adoption of
space and time as subjective forms of intuition. If one finds the claim that a
material object consists of relational properties perplexing (e.g. what are
the relata?), then one could put Kant's claim this way: all the facts about
material objects supervene on facts concerning their relational properties. No
non-relational properties are part of the supervenience base.[^15415]

[^15415]: Given Kant's distinction between phenomena and things as they are in
    themselves, it is plausible that he would deny that the relevant
    phenomenal supervenience base is itself fundamental. Presumably then, the
    relational properties in this supervenience base must themselves depend on
    relational and or non-relational properties of things in themselves. As
    Kant says in a late metaphysics lecture, "A phenomenon is in itself no
    substance, with respect to our senses we call the appearance of substance
    itself substance. But this phenomenal substance <substantia phenomenon>
    must have a noumenon as substrate. This can be called transcendental
    idealism." (*Dohna Metaphyics* 28:682). Thanks to an anonymous referee for
    encouraging clarity on this point.

[^relations]: For discussion of the *Prolegomena* passage see [@allais2007].
For discussion of the status of phenomenal substance as consisting of
relational properties see [@vancleve1988]; [@pereboom1991]; [@langton1998;
-@langton2006]; [@warren2001a, ch. 2]; [@pereboom2011, chs. 5-6]. Kant's
position that matter consists only of extrinsic qualities or relations is not
a denial that matter has qualities which *play the role of intrinsic
qualities*, as it were. These are the "comparatively internal" qualities Kant
speaks of above, which are "self-sufficient and persistent". But the qualities
so picked out in the MFNS are not ones which denote *absolutely intrinsic*
qualities, because these are unknowable to us (Letter to Reinhold, 1789
11:36-7; cf. CPR: Amphiboly, A277/B333; *Notes on Logic*: R2999 (c. 1770-1),
16:609; *Mrongovius Metaphysics* (1782-3), 29:820-1; *Dohna-Wundlacken Logic*
(1792) 24:728). I discuss this point further in §3 below. Note also that in
making the claim that matter is composed only of extrinsic relations, we need
not, with Langton and Warren, endorse the claim that the
thing-in-itself/phenomenal distinction maps cleanly onto the
intrinsic/extrinsic distinction. See [@ameriks2001] and [@watkins2002a] for
criticism of such a claim.

What about Kant's conclusion that outer objects undergo no change except by
motion? How does this follow from the fact that their properties are entirely
relational? Kant's inference would be straightforward if he thought that the
(relational) properties of an outer object are all specifically kinds of
spatial relation (or supervene on kinds of spatial relation). If this were the
case then any change in an object's properties would be or involve a change in
the spatial relations of the object or its parts. This would trivially entail
the occurrence of some motion. 

However, even if we accept that Kant takes phenomenal objects to possess only
relational properties, this doesn't entail that he construes all the
relational properties such objects possess as themselves (types of) spatial
properties. In particular, the "moving forces" present in intuition that Kant
discusses at A49/B67 (cited above) are not obviously *spatial* relations, but
rather (e.g.) dispositional properties of some kind, which *cause* or
*explain* changes in spatial relations.[^17511] This is certainly correct. But
Kant need not claim that all properties of a thing consist in spatial
relations, rather, he need only be understood as claiming that all alterations
in a thing require an alteration in its (or one or more of its parts) spatial
properties. This is relatively trivial to show with respect to change of
quantity of matter, qua outer object. Since Kant construes all change of
quantity in terms of a change in extensive magnitude (see the Axioms of
Intuition in the first *Critique*), and extensive magnitudes come in two
forms, spatial and temporal, any change of extensive magnitude requires a
change in spatial or temporal relations. Since we're just concerned with
*matter* qua outer object, any change in quantity of matter is ipso facto a
change of some spatial relation. 

[^17511]: Thanks to an anonymous referee for encouraging clarification on this point.

The less obvious portion of the supervenience claim concerns changes of
quality, or *intensive* magnitude. If the supervenience claim is correct then
Kant is committed to claiming that all changes in quality (intensive
magnitude) supervene on changes of quantity (extensive magnitude). But why
think that Kant holds this claim, much less that he holds it on a priori
grounds to which he could, in the Preface to the MFNS, appeal?

Some evidence that he does endorse such a view comes from his apparent
position, throughout the first *Critique* that many of the qualities
apprehended via specific sense modalities (e.g. the "proper sensibles" of
color, taste, and smell)

>things like colors, taste, etc., are correctly considered not as qualities of
>things but as mere alterations of our subject, which can even be different in
>different people. (B45)[^191753]

[^191753]: This passage replaces an even more trenchant denial in the first
    edition. Kant says,

   >The pleasant taste of a wine does not belong to the objective
   >determinations of the wine, thus of an objecf even considered as an
   >appearance, but rather to the particular constitution of sense in the
   >subject that enjoys it. Colors are not objective qualities of the bodies
   >to the intuition of which they are attached, but are also only
   >modifications of the sense of sight, which is affected by light in a
   >certain way. (A28)
   
   See [@wilson1984] for discussion; cf. [@rosefeldt2007].
   
\noindent Kant also construes such qualities as intenseive magnitudes. Given
his apparent denial of their full objectivity, it would be fitting to construe
them as varying at least partly as a function of changes of extensive
magnitude, changes which Kant takes to be more straightforwardly "objective". 

This reading gets at least some confirmation from Kant's discussion of
Euler's theory of color, as it appears in Eulers' *Letters to a German
Princess*, concerning the frequency of vibration of refracted light through a
medium. It is the fact that color can be understood in this way that suggests
to Kant the possibility of objective disagreement over color properties of
aesthetic objects (CPJ 5:224; see also 5:324–5).[^151226] Kant is also clearly
committed to construing intensive magnitudes, such as density, as a function
of combinations of extensive magnitudes, such as quantity of matter (mass) and
volume.[^151343] While density can vary with respect to a constant volume, it
cannot vary with respect to constant volume and constant mass, understood as
the quantity of matter filling a space.[^191748] At least one of the latter
two extensive magnitudes must change if there is to be a change in density
(intensive magnitude).

[^191748]: Kant also indicates in the Remark to Proposition 1 of the Mechanics
(MFNS 4:539-40) that changes in intensive magnitudes, such as velocity, cannot
float free of extensive ones. While this falls short of a general claim, it
seems clear that he takes the supervenience claim to hold for all intensive
magnitudes of outer objects and not just velocity.

[^151343]: For discussion of the relationship between intensive and extensive
    magnitudes see [@brittan1986, 66, 77-8] and especially [@friedman2013,
    chs. 2-3].

[^151226]: Euler discusses his wave theory of light in Letters XIX–XXXVI
    (originally written from June to August 1760), vol. I, letters 19-44
    (pp. 70-180) of [@euler1768a]. Euler construes light as propogating in a
    wave-like as opposed to radial fashion. Strictly speaking, he considers
    light emissions in terms of *pulses* and explains the apparent features of
    light, including color, in terms of the velocity and distance between
    pulses. See also [@hakfoort1995, 98]; [@guenova2012, 11-12]. For
    discussion of the extent to which Kant does endorse a kind of scientific
    reduction of "secondary" to "primary" qualities see [@wilson1984].
    
One might object to the supervenience claim on the following textual basis.
In the Anticipations section of the first *Critique* Kant argues that,

>the intensive magnitude in different appearances can be smaller or greater
>even though the extensive magnitude of the intuition remains identical.
>(A173/B214)

\noindent While this may look like a denial of our supervenience claim, Kant
is doing no such thing. Instead he is arguing for the possibility that the
differentiation between kinds of matter may be the result of real differences
in the nature of that which fills space, and is not simply the result of a
uniform kind of matter which is distributed in non-uniform ways through space.
Kant is thus arguing that "mathematical and mechanical students of nature"
make an ungrounded assumption, 

>for they assume that the real in space (I cannot call it here impenetrability
>or weight, since these are empirical concepts), is **everywhere one and the
>same**, and can be differentiated only according to its extensive magnitude,
>i.e., amount. (A173/B215)

\noindent The claim that the real in space can differ (e.g. in density)
without differing in extensive magnitude (e.g. in volume) is not a general
denial that variations in intensive magnitude supervene on variations in
extensive magnitude. Rather the claim Kant is denying is one which holds that
different types of matter of (e.g.) different densities (e.g. the density of a
cubic foot of water vs. that of a cubic foot of lead) ultimately consist of a
single uniform type of matter of absolute density interspersed with regions of
empty space.[^191754]

[^191754]: Kant discusses "interstitial" views of density in the General
    Remark to Dynamics (4:523-4). He also takes Lambert and other
    "mathematical students of nature" to task concerning their conception of
    the "absolute" manner in which matter occupies space, using precisely the
    assumption discussed in the Anticipations in the Remark to Proposition 1
    of the Dynamics chapter (4:497-8). For extensive discussion see
    [@friedman2013, 121-30].

The immediate and perhaps most well-known objection to Kant's claim that all
change involves motion is that it seems conceivable that there could be
change---e.g. qualitative change---without motion. For example, an object
might change color without thereby moving.[^135443] However, I take this
possibility to be ruled out by Kant's view, just discussed, that no alteration
of an outer object can occur without an alteration in the extensive magnitude
of it or one or more of its parts. Since the extensive magnitudes of outer
objects are one and all spatial, there would thus have to occur, even in
qualitative changes such as those of color, some change of spatial
relationships, either in the object or its parts. As we shall see in a moment,
Kant takes this to entail the occurrence of motion.

[^135443]: See [@walker1971, 122] for the most influential version of the
objection; cf. [@watkins1998a, 579-82]. 

We thus have the material for the following argument:

1. The properties of all objects of outer sense consist of relational
   properties. [transcendental idealism]
2. Any alteration of an outer object is, or supervenes, on an alteration in
   extensive magnitude, and thus an alteration of spatial properties.
   [supervenience claim]
3. $\therefore$ Any alteration in an outer object requires a change of spatial
   relation(s). 

\noindent This argument depends on Kant's transcendental idealism, which he
could reasonably have assumed as background to his discussion in the MFNS.
This argument does not yet show, however, that any alteration in an outer
object specifically entails a *motion*. It at best shows only that any
alteration is or involves an alteration of spatial relations. We thus do not
understand how Kant could infer, in the first sentence from the quoted passage
(on page \ref{mechanics}) above, to his desired conclusion that all outer
change occurs via motion. So we need to find a means of connecting the claim
about alteration of spatial relations with the claim concerning motion.

But to see that Kant does indeed endorse this connection between alteration of
spatial relations and motion we need only look to his definition of motion in
the Phoronomy chapter. There he says that "Motion of a thing is the change of
its outer relations to a given space" (MFNS: Phoronomy - Explication 2,
4:482).[^16811] So any change of the outer relations of thing to a given space
is a motion. Hence, if an object's outer relations, or the outer relations of
its parts, change with respect to a given space, then a motion has occurred.
This gives us our needed premise.

[^16811]: Note that Kant is careful to distinguish this conception of motion
from that of alteration of *place*. There can be motion in the sense with which
Kant is concerned without there being change of place (e.g. as with the
rotation of a point). See MFNS 4:482.

1. The properties of all objects of outer sense consist of relational
   properties. [transcendental idealism]
2. Any alteration of an outer object is, or supervenes, on an alteration in
   extensive magnitude, and thus an alteration of spatial properties.
   [supervenience claim]
3. $\therefore$ Any alteration in an outer object requires a change of spatial
   relation(s). [1, 2]
4. Any alteration of spatial relations requires motion [definition].
5. $\therefore$ Any alteration of an outer object requires motion (either of
   it or of its parts). [3, 4]

Kant's argument, as I have reconstructed it, has thus far proceeded from an
analysis of `<motion>` and claims concerning the nature of outer objects based
on his transcendental idealism.[^191749] However, we need a further ancillary
claim if we are to arrive at Kant's desired conclusion that *affection*
requires motion. Here too Kant presumes familiarity with one of the central
claims made in the first *Critique*---viz. the receptivity of sensibility.
Since our sensibility is *receptive* we require affection from something other
than ourselves in order to generate representations (A19/B33,
B75/A51).[^174013] Since our receptivity is *sensory*, the representations
generated by such affection are dependent for their nature and content on the
sense modalities of the being who has them. The occurrence of an outer sensory
representation thus depends on some affection of (one or more sense modalities
of) outer sense.[^174149] Since the affection of a subject's outer sense will
entail, by definition, affection by something external to the subject, and the
form of externality is space, any such affection will *ipso facto* require an
alteration of spatial relationships, either in the subject, the object, or
both.[^191751] Hence, the occurrence of any outer experience requires some external
change. This gives us the final piece of our argument.

[^191751]: At the very least, such an affection would seem to require a change
    in the subject, since the subject changes from not being affected by the
    object to being affected by it. This doesn't require any further empirical
    commitment, on Kant's part, to the nature of this affection, e.g. whether
    it involves local motion.

[^191749]: Kant's claim concerning the connection between alteration and
    motion is not unique. Baumgarten argues for a similar conclusion in his
    *Metaphysica*, with which Kant was well-versed. See Baumgarten's argument
    that "there can be no alteration in a composite world without motion" at
    §415. Of course, Baumgarten's specific argument for this conclusion
    differs significantly from Kant's. 

[^174149]: What about changes solely in inner sense? First, Kant seems to deny
    that inner sense has its own "manifold" (B67, B158-9). See [@allison2004,
    279]; [@valaris2008]; [@schmitz2015] for discussion. Kant also seems to
    deny the existence of inner sense without outer when he says in
    *Metaphysik K~2~* (1790s) that, "I would have no inner sense if I had no
    outer sense" (LM 28:771). There is also the argument of the Refutation of
    Idealism to consider. Kant is there concerned to show that the
    consciousness of one’s own existence is "simultaneously the immediate
    consciousness of the existence [*Dasein*] of other things outside or
    external [*äußer*]" to one (B276). So I take it that there cannot be
    affections of sensibility that do not ultimately depend on the occurrence
    of some affection of outer sense.

[^174013]: What about mathematical representations? These are not sensory (they
have form but no sensory 'matter'), and thus do not count as sensory
representations.

1. The properties of all objects of outer sense consist of relational
   properties. [transcendental idealism]
2. Any alteration of an outer object is, or supervenes, on an alteration in
   extensive magnitude, and thus an alteration of spatial properties.
   [supervenience claim]
3. $\therefore$ Any alteration in an outer object requires a change of spatial
   relation(s). [1, 2]
4. Any alteration of spatial relations requires motion. [definition]
5. $\therefore$ Any alteration of an outer object requires motion. [3, 4]
6. The affection of outer sense (and thus the occurrence of an outer sensory
   representation) requires the alteration of some object of outer sense
   [def of sensible receptivity]
7. $\therefore$ Any affection of outer sense requires the occurrence of a motion
   of some object. [5, 6]

So, given that according to Kant our senses, as receptive, must undergo change
in order to produce representations, we can know apriori that this change must
be due to motion.[^Pollok] The argument does not presume that in order for the
passive senses to be acted upon, the actor must be *local* to the sensing
subject. Kant clearly denies that activity of agent on patient requires locality
in his discussion of the nature of attractive force (Dynamics, 4:513-14). Thus,
all that Kant's argument requires is the claim that to be acted upon, that activity,
or the patient so acted upon, must involve some change of relations in space.

[^Pollok]: Pollok [-@pollok2006, 569] says that the "possibility of such affection by
matter presupposes that it can be determined through motion." He also seems to
interpret Kant's argument in terms of motion as a condition of being given an
object (cf. [@pollok2001, 154]). However, Pollok ultimately seems to take this as
an empirical argument since he says that "the spatial distance between the
subject of cognition and the object of cognition must be somehow traversed." If
my interpretation is cogent then Kant not be understood as making any such
empirical claim. 

The argument also does not show that affection in outer sense requires that the
object affecting one also be the very object in motion. Whether this stronger
claim is in fact what Kant intended is difficult to discern. But the stronger
claim is not, strictly speaking, necessary to provide Kant with what he
wants---viz. a necessary connection between `<matter>` and the possibility of
correctly applying `<motion>` to it.

Thus, Kant's argument---compressed though it may be---is not a dogmatic
assertion or an empirical claim, but rather an a priori argument based on the
nature of our receptivity and the presumption of the transcendental ideality of
space.[^friedman]

[^friedman]: Friedman construes Kant's argument in terms the establishment of a
relative region of space, or reference frame, centered on one's own body, and
which "builds in" the concepts of movability and relative motion. See
[@friedman2013, 43-4]. However, this interpretation seems to presuppose a great
deal more than just the conditions of having an outer (spatial) sense and the
relational constitution of objects in space, both of which are points to which
Kant is antecedently committed. For that reason I believe my interpretation is
preferable.

Moreover, Kant's a priori argument as I've presented it here does not threaten
his claim that the concept `<matter>` is empirical. In contrast to
interpretations which claim that the empirical status of the concept rests on
the conditions of establishing its objective reality I take the empirical status
of `<matter>` to rest on the fact that it contains the mark
`<impenetrability>`.[^objreality] According to Kant, the thinkable content
`<impenetrability>` cannot be entertained without having had a particular kind
of experience, and specifically, the experience of resistance in space. On this
view `<matter>` cannot be thought wholly a priori, because it cannot be thought
in terms of *filling* space (as opposed to the geometer's space-*occupying*
conception) without a specific kind of experience, which we gain via the sense
of touch.[^191752]

[^191752]: One might object here that no experience is needed for the grasp of
    `<impenetrability>`, since it consists only of concepts of force,
    resistance (force in the opposite direction of motion), and space. While
    Kant does not make his reasoning explicit here (far from it), it seems
    clear from his writings on negative magnitudes that he would not have
    regarded as a purely conceptual issue the cancellation of motion that
    comes with the real opposition between the repulsive force of a resisting
    object and the penetrating force of an approaching one (see [@warren2001,
    ch. 1]; [@chignell2010a]). If that is correct then we need to ask where
    the extra-conceptual element would come from. It cannot be simply space,
    since our intuitive grasp of space tells us nothing of cancellation. So
    there must be something else in virtue of which we come to grasp the
    relevant cancellation. This is precisely what I take Kant to construe as
    the importance of the sensation of resistance. Thanks to an anonymous
    referee for encouraging clarity on this point.

In terms of the contingent structure of our sense modalities, this means that we
have to have a particular kind of sensory experience. This is indicated by
Kant's statement in the Remark to Proposition 5 of the Dynamics that the
awareness of repulsive force is acquired via the sense of touch (4:510). He also
endorses this position in the *Anthropology*, which explains why he says there
that touch is the "most important" of the senses (7:155) and, in the
corresponding lectures, says that touch is even necessary for acquiring the
concept of a substance (*Anthropology Friedländer* (1775/6), 25:494; cf.
*Anthropology Mrongovius* (1784/5), 25:1242).[^friends] Hence, insofar as
`<impenetrability>` is a constituent mark of `<matter>`, we cannot think the
entirety of the content of `<matter>` a priori. Instead, we need a certain class
of experience---viz. tactile experience.[^NotOR] 

[^objreality]: Prominent interpretations advocating the view that `<matter>` is
empirical due to the fact that experience is needed to show its objective
reality include [@plaass1966]; [@watkins1998a]; and [@pollok2006].

[^friends]: For a similar take on the status of `<matter>` see [@friedman2001a];
[@warren2010, 240].

[^NotOR]: I thus disagree with Plass, Watkins, and Pollok that the status of
`<matter>` as empirical depends merely on the fact that we cannot know the
concept to be instantiated without having had some outer experience or other.
See [@plaass1966, 288-9]; [@watkins1998a, 571, note 15]; [@pollok2001, 30;
-@pollok2006, 570]. It is not, as they claim, that we can think of matter as
impenetrable but cannot know the *reality* of matter until we have sensation
of it as filling a space. Rather, we cannot even *think* of matter as
*filling* (as opposed to merely occupying) space, unless we have had
sensations of resistance. So it is the *content* and not merely the issue of
the instantiation of `<matter>` that makes it empirical.

Thus far I have presented an interpretation which gives us the necessary
background to understand premise (1) of Kant's original argument:

1.  Affection by an outer object requires motion
2.  $\therefore$ The fundamental determination of matter, as an outer object, is
    *motion*

\noindent I have not yet argued for how or why we should understand this
necessary determination of matter as *fundamental*. It is to this issue that we
now turn.

Watkins's "transcendental argument" interpretation -->

# Fundamentality

<!-- TODO: Revise this section -->

Thus far, I've argued that the affection argument, properly supplemented by
auxiliary premises, presents us with a valid argument for the fundamentality of
`<motion>` as a determination of `<matter>`. At the outset I raised the issue of
the sense in which `<motion>` is fundamental. Is it epistemically fundamental,
in that it is only through our grasp of `<motion>` that we could grasp
`<matter>`? Or is it metaphysically fundamental, in that it designates the
essence of *matter* and its corresponding concept. There are two primary grounds
for doubting that Kant could have the latter metaphysical notion in mind. 

First, Kant explicitly denies that we have access to the metaphysical essence or
nature of any thing.

> I can easily find the logical essence of a given concept, namely its
> *primitive constitutiva*, as well as the attributes, as *rationata logica* of
> this essence, by means of the analysis of my concepts into all that I think
> under them. But the **real** essence (the nature) of any object, that is, the
> primary *inner* ground of *all* that **necessarily belongs** to a given thing,
> this is impossible for man to discover in regard to any object." (May 12th,
> 1789; C 11:36-7)[^15480]

[^15480]: Cf. CPR: Amphiboly, A277/B333; \emph{Notes on Logic}: R2999 (c.
1770-1), 16:609; \emph{Mrongovius Metaphysics} (1782-3), 29:820-1; \emph
{Dohna-Wundlacken Logic} (1792), 24:728.

\noindent Kant's notion of a 'primary inner ground' here is that of a
determination intrinsic to the thing, necessary for it to be the kind of
thing that it is, and explanatorily foundational, in the sense that the other
properties of the thing 'flow from' or are otherwise derived (or derivable)
from it (*Notes on Logic*: R2916 (either 1764-8 or 1778-9), 16:575; cf.
16:576-607). This 'real essence', Kant argues, is strictly unknowable to us. By
contrast the logical essence of a *concept* consists of those marks sufficient
for distinguishing its object from others. Since Kant's discussion here is
wholly general, it strongly suggests that he takes the epistemic reach of our
concepts to be limited, and thus that we should not take the notion of a
'fundamental determination' to be one which discloses the real essence of
matter.<!-- TODO: Add citations for logical/real distinction -->

Second, while we may be able to make the fundamental forces designated by
`<attraction>` and `<repulsion>` ultimately intelligible only via a grasp of
their relation to `<motion>`---this is why Kant says that it is the
*understanding* that traces all predicates back to `<motion>`---there would seem
to be an important difference between `<motion>` as a determination of
`<matter>` and other determinations such as `<attraction>` and `<repulsion>`.
The difference is that it is the forces indicated by the latter two concepts which
ultimately metaphysically explain the features of matter, including its motion,
and more generally, its power to move and be moved, not the other way around.
One way of putting this is that Kant's argument for the fundamentality of
`<motion>` provides us not with the *ratio essendi* of matter, but with its
*ratio cognoscendi*.[^164523] 

[^164523]: See also [@pollok2001, 151].

For an example of the distinct roles of epistemic and metaphysical
fundamentality we need look no further than the Dynamics, where Kant defines the
filling of space by means of an appeal to motion. He says,

> *Matter* is the *movable* insofar as it *fills* a *space*. To *fill* a space
> is to resist every movable that strives through its motion to penetrate into a
> certain space. A space that is not filled is an *empty space*. (4:496)

So what it is to be matter is to fill space, what it is to fill space is not
wholly intelligible without an appeal to `<motion>`. This is because the notion
of filling space is, as Kant puts it above, one understood in terms of the
resistance of a body to the intrusive *changes of location* (i.e. motions) made
by other bodies.[^warrenmotion] Nevertheless, it makes no sense to think of the
force of resistance as "flowing from" motion, in the way that features of an
object were traditionally thought to flow from, or depend upon the object's
essence. Rather, resistance is a power of the substance which fills that space.
So there is an important sense in which the mark `<motion>` cannot be anything
other than the logical ground of the concept and thus not a real ground of a
material object's features.[^191747]

[^warrenmotion]: See also [@warren2010, note 56, 239-40].

[^191747]: For discussion of Kant's views on real vs. logical grounds see
[@watkins2005, 162-5]; cf. [@longuenesse2005a, 129-31]. 

The fact that Kant seeks to base his metaphysics of nature on an epistemically
rather than metaphysically fundamental feature, as well as his (at least
implicit) recognition that the two kinds of feature can come apart, is (as one
might say) a feature, rather than a bug, of his overall view. Rationalist
conceptions of scientific knowledge collapse epistemic and metaphysical
fundamentality. For example, Descartes considers `<extension>` to be *both*
metaphysically and epistemically fundamental (Meditations AT VII:63; cf. AT
VII:423). The fundamentality of `<extension>` is derived, at least in part, from
its epistemic centrality in our conception of matter (e.g. Principles AT VIIIA
30-31). This purely geometric conception of matter would lead to a conception of
"absolute" impenetrability or solidity that Kant roundly criticizes in the
MFNS.[^solid] Kant instead endorses a "dynamical" rather than "mathematical"
conception of matter (MFNS: General Remark 4:524-5), which is in certain ways
more limited than Descartes's conception, since it does not allow for an a
priori deduction of all the possible features a material body might possess.
Nevertheless, Kant thinks the dynamicist conception of matter enjoys a certain
explanatory advantage---viz. it explains the existence of motion in a system by
appeal to the more fundamental power of a material body to exert repulsive or
attractive force.[^153734] In contrast, the geometric conception of matter must
take the presence of some quantity of motion in a system as given, the ultimate
explanation of which depends on an appeal to God's action in setting the system
in motion (e.g. Principles AT II.36 VIIIA:61-2).

[^153734]: For an examination of this view as it appears in Kant's metaphysics
lectures see [@warren2010, 208-10].

[^solid]: The difference is that between an "absolute" notion of space filling,
which is all or nothing---i.e. admitting of no compression of any degree, and
the dynamical view, which takes space filling to admit of a degree, measured as
the extent of outward-directed force by which a parcel of matter opposed
compression. For relevant discussion see [@warren2010].

This is not to say that Kant holds the dynamical view of matter *because of* the
fact that it aligns with his view that we have a priori access to `<motion>`,
but not to `<impenetrability>`, as determinations of `<matter>`. That would be
a stronger claim than the one I make here. All I am pointing out is that the
view of the fundamentality of `<motion>` that I attribute to Kant here is fully
consistent with, and complimentary to, his broader dynamicist theory.

Thus, when we look at the argument as a whole, we see the following:

1. The properties of all objects of outer sense consist of relational
   properties. [transcendental idealism]
2. Any alteration of an outer object is, or supervenes, on an alteration in
   extensive magnitude, and thus an alteration of spatial properties.
   [supervenience claim]
3. $\therefore$ Any alteration in an outer object requires a change of spatial
   relation(s). [1, 2]
4. Any alteration of spatial relations requires motion. [definition]
5. $\therefore$ Any alteration of an outer object requires motion. [3, 4]
6. The affection of outer sense (and thus the occurrence of an outer sensory
   representation) requires the alteration of some object of outer sense
   [def of sensible receptivity]
7. $\therefore$ Any affection of outer sense requires the occurrence of a motion
   of some object. [5, 6]
8. $\therefore$ `<motion>` is required to grasp the concept of being affected by
   an object of outer sense. [6, 7]
9. $\therefore$ `<motion>` is an epistemically fundamental determination of
   `<matter>`, as an outer object. [8]

\noindent I note two things about this argument. First, it's conclusion
concerning the fundamentality of `<motion>` is more explicit than that which
Kant provides in the Introduction at 4:476. But I have given reasons above for
thinking that Kant holds that `<motion>` is only epistemically rather than
metaphysically fundamental. 

Second, the argument is a progressive argument, which starts from positions that
Kant has either argued for (transcendental idealism) or otherwise committed
himself to (our receptive sensible nature), and moves to a conclusion concerning
the status of `<matter>`. I thus regard Kant's argument as a combination of
substantive commitments from his critical philosophy plus conceptual analysis. I
do not see him as engaging in a transcendental argument, which starts from some
commonly accepted fact and regressively argues to a conclusion concerning the
necessary conditions for the possibility of that fact.[^155130] This is not to
say that Kant does not employ transcendental arguments in the course of
elaborating his position in the MFNS, just that I do not see him as utilizing one
in making this particular claim about the fundamentality of `<motion>`. 

[^155130]: For discussion of Kant's argument as a form of transcendental
argument see [@watkins1998a, 577-87]; cf. [@cramer1985]. For discussion of a
transcendental argument as regressive see [@ameriks1978].

That Kant might present an argument in the MFNS which implicitly presupposes
substantive commitments from his critical philosophy should not be surprising.
He is clearly engaged in the elaboration of his critical system in the
Introduction to the MFNS.[^161926] So it is only natural that he might
therefore draw on that system in his initial argument. My interpretation ties
Kant's argument in the MFNS, or at least its initial stages, more closely to his
commitments in the first *Critique* and the Aesthetic especially. This may not
be welcomed by all.[^163923] But making this tie explicit has the benefit of
presenting Kant's doctrines as importantly unified. It also makes Kant's
transcendental idealism---specifically, his transcendental doctrines concerning
space and time---a central aspect of his foundational physical theory. This
seems only fitting given Kant's emphasis on the forms of intuition as the
foundation of our a priori mathematical knowledge, and of the special
metaphysics of nature provided by the MFNS as an explanation of how "natural
science is either a pure or applied *doctrine of motion* throughout" (MFNS
Introduction, 4:477).

[^163923]: For example, [@stan2016b] explicitly distances his interpretation of
Kant's mechanics from the assumptions of the Transcendental Aesthetic. However,
Stan also is explicit that his account is a neo-Kantian rational reconstruction.

[^161926]: For example, there is a great deal of resemblance between the
discussion of science in the Introduction and the discussion in the
Architectonic section of the first *Critique* (cf. A845-9/B873-7).

Hence, the sense in which `<motion>` is a fundamental determination of
`<matter>`, to which all others are traced back is, as I have argued here, an
epistemic rather than metaphysical claim. There is certainly more to say about
the exact *way* in which this determination is fundamental, and perhaps even
more about how and why it is "fecund" in the sense I articulated in the
introduction, but that must wait for another time.[^fecund] Here I aim to have
shown only that Kant's affection argument for the fundamentality of `<motion>`
in our conception of matter is neither dogmatic nor irredeemably obscure. It is
an a priori argument that uses, as auxiliary premises, claims stemming from
Kant's other general theoretical commitments---viz. the transcendental ideality
of space and the receptivity of sensibility.

[^fecund]: Such a discussion would need to show how `<motion>` has to (i)
provide a basis from which other cognitions may be (asymetrically) derived and
(ii) do so in a manner that is consistent only with one particular way of
expositing the concept, as Kant indicates in his discussion of exposition in the
Transcendental Aesthetic (B40). With respect to (i), it is clear that at least
one mark of `<matter>` is taken by Kant to be derived synthetically and a
priori---viz. the mark `<attraction>`. Kant argues that attractive force is not
an original part of the given concept `<matter>`. It is added to the concept via
the complex "balancing argument" of the Dynamics, Propositions 5 and 6. I hope
to pursue issues surrounding Kant's conception of the fecundity of `<motion>` in
future work.
